# Interactive Reviewer Response

**[Live Demo](https://hosniadilemp-a11y.github.io/websiteReviewers/)**

This project is an interactive dashboard designed to present responses to paper reviewers in a structured, navigable, and visually appealing format. It parses reviewer comments from a LaTeX file and displays them in a modern web interface.

## Features

- **Network Science Theme:** A tech-inspired "Computer Science / Network Analysis" aesthetic with grid backgrounds and monospaced typography.
- **Rich Content:** Renders LaTeX formulas (MathJax), tables, and images.
- **Stats & Badges:** Visual indicators for experiments, revisions, and new content.
- **Dark Mode:** A realistic 3D toggle for light/dark themes.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Data Source

The content is generated from `main.tex` and parsed into `data.js`.
