        "response": "We thank the editor for your constructive feedback and for providing us the opportunity to revise our manuscript. \nWe sincerely appreciate your time and the detailed comments, which have significantly helped us to improve the paper and better align it with the journal's focus on Supercomputing.\n\nWe fully recognize the importance of explicitly justifying the need for High-Performance Computing (HPC) capabilities, real-time performance, and parallel/distributed processing. \nYour comment is crucial because it underscores the core mission of the journal and ensures that the published work genuinely contributes to the supercomputing community. \nWe have taken this comment very seriously and have thoroughly revised the manuscript to make a strong, consistent case for the relevance of our work to HPC.\n\nTo address your comment, we have made substantial revisions throughout the paper. Below, we detail the specific changes we have implemented.\n\n<b>1. Addition of a Novel HPC-Oriented Theoretical Framework: Line Graph Pruning</b>\n\nA central enhancement to our manuscript is the introduction of a principled <b>Line Graph Pruning</b> framework (Section 3.5), specifically designed for HPC environments. \nThis framework directly addresses the computational bottleneck of line graphs—their enormous edge count—by systematically reducing edges while preserving structural and spectral properties. \nThe pruning serves a dual purpose: (1) as a compression technique to fit larger graphs into memory, and (2) as a regularization mechanism to improve generalization by removing noisy connections.\n\nThe theoretical foundation is built on a <b>spectral distortion factor</b> \\(\\kappa\\), which quantifies how much the Laplacian spectrum (and thus global connectivity properties) is altered. \nWe prove bounds on \\(\\kappa\\) for our pruning strategies, ensuring that the pruned graph remains a faithful representation of the original. \nThis theoretical grounding is crucial for HPC because it provides guarantees that aggressive compression will not break the model's accuracy.\n\nWe propose and analyze three parallel-friendly pruning strategies:\n\n<ol>\n    <li><b>k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) Spectral Pruning:</b> Retains only the top-\\(k\\) most similar neighbors for each node based on feature vectors. This strategy is highly parallelizable, as the distance computations and sorting for each node are independent. We provide an algorithm (Algorithm 2) and a theorem bounding the spectral distortion.\n    <li><b>Spectral Sparsification via Effective Resistance Sampling:</b> Samples edges with probability proportional to their <i>effective resistance</i>, a measure of their importance in global connectivity. We employ a nearly-linear time approximation via Johnson-Lindenstrauss random projections, making it feasible for large graphs. The algorithm (Algorithm 3) includes a parameter \\(\\alpha\\) to explicitly control the preservation ratio, offering a tunable trade-off between efficiency and fidelity. This method is ideal for distributed settings as it minimizes communication overhead by preserving critical bridges.\n    <li><b>Degree-Based Hierarchical Pruning:</b> Leverages the power-law degree distribution of real-world graphs by removing edges incident to either very high-degree or very low-degree nodes. This simple strategy is extremely fast and reduces adjacency matrix density, improving cache locality—a critical factor in HPC performance.\n</ol>\n\nA key theoretical result is <b>Lemma 2 (Training Time Reduction)</b>, which formally proves that pruning reduces per-epoch training time by a factor of \\(\\alpha\\) (the preservation ratio) and proportionally reduces communication overhead in distributed settings. This lemma provides a direct, quantitative link between our pruning framework and HPC performance gains.\n\n<b>2. Comprehensive Experimental Validation of HPC Performance</b>\n\nWe have added an experimental section (Section 4) dedicated to non-functional performance metrics, validating the scalability and efficiency of LineML in HPC contexts.\n\n<b>2.1 Pruning Strategies: Performance-Scalability Trade-offs</b>\nWe rigorously evaluate our three pruning methods across multiple datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed, Physics). Table 1 shows that:\n<ul>\n    <li><b>kNN pruning with k=10</b> achieves the best balance, removing  76% of edges while maintaining or even improving AUC.\n    <li>Pruning provides near-linear reduction in training time (e.g., 4.6\\(\\times\\) speedup on Physics with kNN pruning), confirming Lemma 1.\n    <li>The benefits are most pronounced on large graphs, justifying the need for HPC to handle such scale.\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"table-container\"><table><tr><td><b>Methods</b></td><td><b>Param</b></td><td><b>Pruned (%)</b></td><td colspan=\"2\"><b>Cora</b></td><td colspan=\"2\"><b>CiteSeer</b></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><b>AUC (Imp)</b></td><td><b>Time</b></td><td><b>AUC (Imp)</b></td><td><b>Time</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><i>Baseline (Unpruned)</i></td><td>95.14</td><td>10.79s</td><td>96.85</td><td>13.29s</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"6\">Degree Pruning</td><td>high \\(\\tau =0.1\\)</td><td>64.1%</td><td><b>95.19 (0.05%)</b></td><td>8.8s (1.2\\(\\times\\))</td><td><b>95.03 (-1.88%)</b></td><td>6.4s (2.1\\(\\times\\))</td></tr><tr><td>low \\(\\tau =0.1\\)</td><td>35.9%</td><td>95.22 (0.08%)</td><td>9.0s (1.2\\(\\times\\))</td><td>90.56 (-6.49%)</td><td>8.2s (1.6\\(\\times\\))</td></tr><tr><td>high \\(\\tau =0.3\\)</td><td>31.2%</td><td>95.06 (-0.08%)</td><td>9.4s (1.1\\(\\times\\))</td><td>94.04 (-2.90%)</td><td>7.9s (1.7\\(\\times\\))</td></tr><tr><td>low \\(\\tau =0.3\\)</td><td>68.8%</td><td>93.04 (-2.21%)</td><td>7.4s (1.5\\(\\times\\))</td><td>89.79 (-7.29%)</td><td>6.9s (1.9\\(\\times\\))</td></tr><tr><td>high \\(\\tau =0.5\\)</td><td>19.3%</td><td>95.84 (0.74%)</td><td>15.2s (0.7\\(\\times\\))</td><td>94.33 (-2.60%)</td><td>9.7s (1.4\\(\\times\\))</td></tr><tr><td>low \\(\\tau =0.5\\)</td><td>80.7%</td><td>90.85 (-4.51%)</td><td>6.2s (1.7\\(\\times\\))</td><td>88.71 (-8.40%)</td><td>6.4s (2.1\\(\\times\\))</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"5\">Spectral Pruning</td><td>\\(\\lambda=0.1\\)</td><td>90.0%</td><td>70.91 (-25.47%)</td><td>7.4s (1.5\\(\\times\\))</td><td>76.98 (-20.52%)</td><td>6.7s (2.0\\(\\times\\))</td></tr><tr><td>\\(\\lambda=0.3\\)</td><td>70.0%</td><td>82.20 (-13.60%)</td><td>8.2s (1.3\\(\\times\\))</td><td>89.70 (-7.38%)</td><td>8.5s (1.6\\(\\times\\))</td></tr><tr><td>\\(\\lambda=0.5\\)</td><td>50.0%</td><td>90.58 (-4.79%)</td><td>8.6s (1.3\\(\\times\\))</td><td>91.81 (-5.20%)</td><td>11.5s (1.2\\(\\times\\))</td></tr><tr><td><b>\\(\\lambda=0.7\\)</b></td><td><b>30.0%</b></td><td><b>94.39 (-0.79%)</b></td><td><b>9.9s (1.1\\(\\times\\))</b></td><td><b>92.40 (-4.59%)</b></td><td><b>12.9s (1.0\\(\\times\\))</b></td></tr><tr><td>\\(\\lambda=0.9\\)</td><td>10.0%</td><td>95.06 (-0.08%)</td><td>10.0s (1.1\\(\\times\\))</td><td>93.30 (-3.67%)</td><td>13.0s (1.0\\(\\times\\))</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"3\">Knn Pruning</td><td>\\(k=2\\)</td><td>94.9%</td><td>85.62 (-10.01%)</td><td>6.5s (1.7\\(\\times\\))</td><td>88.61 (-8.51%)</td><td>5.5s (2.4\\(\\times\\))</td></tr><tr><td>\\(k=5\\)</td><td>87.8%</td><td>93.18 (-2.06%)</td><td>6.2s (1.7\\(\\times\\))</td><td>93.69 (-3.26%)</td><td>6.5s (2.0\\(\\times\\))</td></tr><tr><td><b>\\(k=10\\)</b></td><td><b>75.9%</b></td><td><b>95.61 (0.49%)</b></td><td><b>8.8s (1.2\\(\\times\\))</b></td><td><b>96.01 (-0.87%)</b></td><td><b>6.7s (2.0\\(\\times\\))</b></td></tr></table></div>\n\n<b>2.2 High-Performance Computing Integration and Scalability</b>\nWe implemented a distributed training pipeline using PyTorch's Distributed Data Parallel across multiple GPUs.

Explicit HPC Justification Throughout the Manuscript</b>\n\nWhile our original solution inherently relied on HPC principles, we acknowledge that this dependency was not stated with sufficient clarity throughout the manuscript. \nIn the revised version, we have systematically and explicitly positioned HPC as a <i>foundational requirement</i> rather than an auxiliary enhancement. \nWe believe these revisions now fully align the manuscript with the standards and expectations of a supercomputing-focused journal.\n\nBelow, we summarize how HPC justification has been strengthened and integrated across the paper.\n\n<b>Abstract</b>\nThe abstract has been restructured to immediately establish the <b>HPC motivation</b>. \nWe now explicitly identify the core computational bottleneck: the quadratic growth of line graphs, which transforms graphs with millions of edges into structures with tens of millions of interactions. \nThis growth is clearly stated as <i>necessitating high-performance computing resources</i>.\n\nLineML is introduced not only as a learning framework but as an HPC-enabled solution, whose design explicitly incorporates pruning and parallel training mechanisms. \nWe highlight spectral pruning and multi-GPU distributed data parallelism as essential components for mitigating quadratic complexity. \nThe abstract now concludes with quantitative HPC benefits, reporting a 4.6\\(\\times\\) reduction in training time via pruning and a 13.98\\(\\times\\) speedup through distributed training. \nThis framing establishes a clear problem—solution narrative grounded in supercomputing.\n\n<b>Introduction</b>\nThe introduction has been reorganized around a clear <b>three-part argument</b> demonstrating why HPC is a prerequisite for our approach:\n\n<ol>\n    <li><b>Methodological Advantage:</b> We present line graph reformulation as a theoretically superior strategy for direct edge modeling. This claim is formalized through Theorem 5, which establishes the expressivity of line graph-based GNNs relative to the 1-Weisfeiler—Lehman test.\n    \n    <li><b>Computational Bottleneck:</b> We explicitly state that this expressivity comes at a cost. The quadratic expansion of the line graph leads to explosive memory and computation requirements, rendering conventional processing infeasible for large-scale networks and <i>explicitly motivating the need for HPC</i>.\n    \n    <li><b>HPC-Centric Solution:</b> LineML is introduced as a scalable system designed for HPC environments. We emphasize that pruning strategies (kNN spectral pruning, effective resistance sampling, and degree-based hierarchical pruning) and distributed multi-GPU training are not optional optimizations, but necessary mechanisms to enable practical deployment on graphs with millions of edges.\n</ol>\n\nThis structure ensures that readers clearly understand that HPC is a precondition for applying the theoretically motivated line graph approach at scale.\n\n<b>Theoretical and Experimental Integration of HPC</b>\n\nHPC considerations are now woven throughout the technical development of the manuscript:\n\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Formalization of Quadratic Growth:</b> We explicitly establish the computational explosion induced by line graph construction through Theorem 1, which quantifies node and edge growth and motivates the need for pruning and parallelization.\n    \n    <li><b>Section 4.2 (Line Graph Pruning — Theoretical Framework):</b> This new subsection is explicitly designed for HPC settings. We introduce the spectral distortion factor to control pruning quality and present Lemma 1, which theoretically demonstrates that training time and communication overhead scale linearly with the pruning ratio in distributed environments. This directly links algorithmic design to HPC performance gains.\n    \n    <li><b>Section 5 (Computational Efficiency and Scalability):</b> A dedicated experimental section now empirically validates our HPC claims:\n    <ol>\n        <li><b>Pruning Effectiveness:</b> We show that kNN pruning removes up to 75.9% of line graph edges while preserving or improving accuracy, enabling larger-scale processing.\n        <li><b>Distributed Training and Scalability:</b> We demonstrate a PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) implementation, achieving a 13.98\\(\\times\\) speedup on the Physics dataset. Scaling behavior and communication thresholds are analyzed to provide practical HPC deployment insights.\n        <li><b>Comparative Efficiency:</b> We show that Parallel LineML trains 14.09\\(\\times\\) faster than the baseline line graph method (LGLP), substantially narrowing the computational gap between line graph methods and original-graph approaches.\n    </ol>\n</ul>\n\nThrough these revisions, HPC is now explicitly articulated as a central design principle across theoretical motivation, algorithmic development, and experimental validation. We hope that this revised manuscript now clearly meets the scope, rigor, and expectations of a supercomputing journal and satisfactorily addresses the reviewer’s concern.",

These improvements are statistically validated: Cliff's Delta effect sizes (Figure 2) show large effects (\\(\\delta \\geq 0.73\\)) against most baselines, with LGLP being the closest competitor (\\(\\delta = 0.52\\)).\n\n\n<b>B. Contribution of Line Graph Transformation and Overcoming Its Bottlenecks</b>\n\n\\paragraph{Crucial Role of Line Graph Transformation}\nThe line graph transformation is fundamental to LineML's effectiveness. \nBy reformulating link prediction as node classification on the line graph \\(L(G)\\), we enable GNNs to leverage higher-order structural patterns that are inaccessible in the original graph. \nTheorem 5 establishes that a \\(k\\)-layer GNN on \\(L(G)\\) is at least as expressive as \\(k\\) iterations of the 1-WL test on \\(G\\) for edge discrimination. \nThis theoretically justifies why LineML outperforms methods that operate solely on the original graph (e.g., GAE, SEAL) or use only first-order heuristics (e.g., Katz, PR). \nThe transformation captures edge--edge relationships, which are critical for link prediction in sparse networks.\n\n\\paragraph{Overcoming Computational Bottlenecks via Pruning and Parallel Training}\nWe directly address the scalability challenge of line graphs through three novel pruning strategies, each designed for HPC environments:\n<ol>\n    <li><b>kNN Spectral Pruning:</b> Retains the top-\\(k\\) most similar neighbors per node based on feature distances, preserving local structure while removing redundant edges.\n    <li><b>Spectral Sparsification via Effective Resistance:</b> Samples edges proportional to their effective resistance, guaranteeing \\(\\epsilon\\)-spectral approximation of the original Laplacian.\n    <li><b>Degree-Based Hierarchical Pruning:</b> Removes edges incident to high- or low-degree nodes, leveraging degree heterogeneity.\n</ol>\n\nTable [Ref] shows the key pruning results:\n\n><table><tr><td>{llccccc}\n\n\n<b>Methods</b></td><td><b>Param</b></td><td><b>Pruned

Effect of Metric Learning: Sampling Strategies and Negative Ratios</b>\n\n\\paragraph{Improvements via Informed Sampling}\nLineML integrates metric learning with advanced negative sampling strategies, moving beyond first-order heuristics. We systematically evaluate four strategies (Section 5.2.3):\n<ol>\n    <li><b>Random Sampling:</b> Unbiased but includes many trivial negatives.\n    <li><b>Degree-Based Sampling:</b> Favors negatives between high-degree nodes, preserving network heterogeneity.\n    <li><b>Common Neighbor Sampling:</b> Focuses on locally dense regions, suitable for social networks.\n    <li><b>Hard Negative Sampling:</b> Adaptively selects challenging negatives based on current embeddings.\n</ol>\n\n\\paragraph{Findings}\nFigure [Ref] shows the performance comparison:\n\n\n    \n    \n    <div class=\"table-caption\">Table: ROC-AUC comparison of negative sampling strategies with and without metric learning. While random sampling can yield high peak scores, degree-based sampling provides the most reliable balance between accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.</div>\n    \n\n\nKey findings:\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Degree-based sampling</b> paired with metric learning provides the optimal balance: median AUC of <b>0.959</b> with low variance (IQR=0.033), outperforming common neighbor and hard sampling.\n    <li>Metric learning consistently boosts performance across all strategies, most notably for random sampling (by <b>+4.2%</b>), demonstrating its role in imposing structured separation.\n</ul>\n\n\\paragraph{Impact of Negative-to-Positive Ratio}\nWe systematically evaluate robustness under extreme class imbalance by varying the negative-to-positive ratio from 1:1 to 100:1 (Figure [Ref]). Metric learning proves crucial: at the 100:1 ratio, it improves AP by <b>42.1%</b> and F1 by <b>48.8%</b> compared to non-metric training. This demonstrates LineML's effectiveness in maintaining discriminative power under severe sparsity through explicit geometric constraints in the embedding space.\n\n\n    \n    \n    <div class=\"table-caption\">Table: Effect of negative sampling ratio on AUC, AP, and F1. Best overall performance is achieved at a 2:1 ratio, with metric learning consistently outperforming non-metric learning.</div>\n    \n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Comparison with Other Metric Losses}\nFigure [Ref] shows that LineML's adaptive triplet loss achieves the highest median AUC (<b>96.7%</b>) and lowest variance, outperforming standard triplet, cosine embedding, and multi-similarity losses. This confirms the effectiveness of our adaptive formulation.\n\n\n  \n  \n  <div class=\"table-caption\">Table: ROC-AUC distributions for different metric learning approaches: adaptive triplet, standard triplet, cosine embedding, multi-similarity, and cross-entropy.</div>\n  \n\n\n\\paragraph*{Revisions to the Theoretical and Empirical Analysis}\nThe revised manuscript has been substantially enhanced with expanded theoretical foundations and additional empirical analysis to more clearly articulate the contributions of LineML.\n\n<ul>\n    <li><em><b>First, Proposition 2 has been added</b> (Section 3.7)</em> to provide a rigorous formalization of the gradient scaling and active set expansion properties of the adaptive triplet loss, establishing the mathematical mechanism by which it accelerates learning on difficult examples compared to a fixed-margin loss.\n    \n    <li><em><b>Second, a new Theorem 5</b> (Section 4.4.5)</em> has been introduced, which establishes the expressivity of GNNs operating on line graphs by proving their equivalence to the Weisfeiler-Lehman test for edge discrimination, thereby providing the theoretical justification for the line graph transformation's superiority over first-order methods.\n    \n    <li><em><b>Third, the newly added line graph pruning section (Section 3.5)</b></em> now includes formal spectral distortion bounds and approximation guarantees (Lemma 2) that quantify the trade-off between computational reduction and structural preservation, underpinning the practical efficiency gains.\n    \n    <li><em><b>Fourth, the non-functional performance analysis (Section 4.4)</b></em> has been expanded with comprehensive scalability experiments, including distributed training results and a detailed comparison of inference latency, demonstrating LineML's practical viability for HPC environments.\n    \n    <li><em><b>Fifth, the metric learning framework analysis (Section 5.2)</b></em> has been augmented with new findings on the impact of negative sampling strategies (Figure 10) and the negative-to-positive ratio (Figure 11), providing empirical guidance for optimal configuration and highlighting the critical role of adaptive metric learning in handling class imbalance.\n</ul>\n\nThese additions collectively strengthen the paper's theoretical grounding and provide comprehensive empirical evidence for the design choices and performance advantages of the LineML framework.\n\nWe hope this detailed response clarifies the novel contributions of LineML and addresses your concerns.

This new subsection provides a structured overview of classical and modern NMF techniques that have been widely used for representation learning and link prediction in networks. In particular, we now discuss:\n<ol>\n\n<li> the foundational formulation of NMF introduced by Lee, D. D., and Seung, H. S., ``Learning the parts of objects by non-negative matrix factorization,'' <em>Nature</em>, vol. 401, no. 6755, pp. 788--791, 1999;  \n<li> comprehensive methodological surveys of NMF and its applications to large-scale data analysis by Wang, Y.

W., ``A deep matrix factorization method for learning attribute representations,'' in <em>Proceedings of the 22nd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)</em>, IEEE, 2014;  \n<li> recent deep NMF approaches explicitly designed for community detection and link prediction by Chen, G., Zhou, S., and Liu, Y., ``Deep nonnegative matrix factorization for community detection and link prediction,'' <em>Journal of Intelligent  and   Fuzzy Systems</em>, vol. 43, no. 4, pp. 4567--4579, 2022;  \n<li> state-of-the-art NMF-based link prediction frameworks incorporating edge generation mechanisms by Yao, Y., He, Y., Huang, Z., Xu, Z., Yang, F., Tang, J., and Gao, K., ``Deep non-negative matrix factorization with edge generator for link prediction in complex networks,'' <em>Applied Intelligence</em>, vol. 54, no. 1, pp. 592--613, 2024; and  \n<li> recent temporal and graph-regularized NMF models targeting large-scale and dynamic networks by Li, M., Zhou, S., Wang, D., and Chen, G., ``A unified temporal link prediction framework based on nonnegative matrix factorization and graph regularization,'' <em>The Journal of Supercomputing</em>, vol. 81, no. 6, p. 774, 2025.  \n    \n</ol>\n\nThis addition clarifies the conceptual position of LineML relative to both traditional and deep NMF-based approaches.\n\n<b>Inclusion of NMF-based baselines in the experimental evaluation.</b>  \nBeyond the literature review, we have strengthened the experimental section by explicitly incorporating NMF-based models as competitive baselines. In particular, we added <b>Deep Non-negative Matrix Factorization (DNMF)</b> as a representative and recent NMF-based link prediction method. This addition follows the reviewer\u2019s recommendation and was also independently raised by another reviewer, reinforcing its relevance. DNMF is now evaluated using the same datasets, training ratios, and evaluation metrics as all other baselines, ensuring a fair and controlled comparison. The corresponding results are reported in the revised Tables 2 and 3.\n\n<b>Clarifying the comparative advantage of LineML.</b>  \nWith the inclusion of NMF-based baselines, the revised experimental results now demonstrate that LineML consistently outperforms or remains competitive with DNMF across multiple datasets and network categories. \nMore importantly, the revised discussion explains <em>why</em> these differences arise: NMF-based methods rely on low-rank factorization of adjacency matrices and model relationships implicitly, whereas LineML treats edges as first-class entities through line-graph transformation and leverages graph neural message passing combined with adaptive metric learning. \nThis design enables more expressive modeling of higher-order edge interactions and improved robustness under severe class imbalance.\n\nThe manuscript now provides a complete and balanced comparison. We believe these additions fully address the reviewer\u2019s concern and substantially strengthen the evidence supporting the effectiveness and generality of the proposed LineML framework.",

Each strategy encodes different inductive biases about which non-edges are most informative:\n\n<b>1. Random Sampling:</b>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Theoretical Basis:</b> Yields an unbiased sample from the non-edge distribution that maintains the overall statistical characteristics of $E^-$.\n    <li><b>Learning Implication:</b> Presents a mixture of trivial and challenging examples proportional to their natural occurrence. While unbiased, it may waste capacity on easy negatives that offer minimal learning signal.\n    <li><b>Efficiency:</b> $O(1)$ sampling complexity but requires $O(|V|^2)$ memory for precomputation.\n</ul>\n\n<b>2. Degree-Based Sampling:</b>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Theoretical Basis:</b> Leverages scale-free network properties where $p_{uv}^{\\text{deg}} \\propto d_u \\cdot d_v$. Non-edges between high-degree nodes are statistically surprising under random connection models.\n    <li><b>Learning Implication:</b> Focuses learning on challenging, structurally plausible negatives. Forces the model to learn why certain high-degree pairs remain unconnected despite statistical likelihood.\n    <li><b>Efficiency:</b> $O(|V|)$ preprocessing, $O(\\log |V|)$ sampling via alias method, making it highly scalable.\n</ul>\n\n<b>3. Common Neighbor Sampling:</b>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Theoretical Basis:</b> Based on sociological triadic closure principles, with $p_{uv}^{\\text{cn}} \\propto \\text{Jaccard}(u,v)^\\gamma$.\n    <li><b>Learning Implication:</b> Emphasizes locally plausible negatives, particularly effective in social networks but may introduce locality bias unsuitable for non-social networks.\n    <li><b>Efficiency:</b> $O(|V|\\langle d^2\\rangle)$ similarity computations, moderately expensive.\n</ul>\n\n<b>4. Hard Negative Sampling:</b>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Theoretical Basis:</b> Adaptive strategy where $p_{uv}^{\\text{hard}} \\propto \\exp(\\phi_\\theta(u,v)/\\tau)$ evolves with model capability.\n    <li><b>Learning Implication:</b> Maximizes learning signal by presenting the most challenging examples, but risks training instability if negatives are too hard early in training.\n    <li><b>Efficiency:</b> $O(|V|^2)$ for exact computation, requiring sophisticated approximations for scalability.\n</ul>\n\n<b>II-Empirical Impact and Analysis</b>\n\nWe conducted systematic experiments comparing all four sampling strategies across our 18 benchmark datasets. The results, presented in Section 5.1.3 and visualized in Figure [Ref], demonstrate clear performance differences:\n\n\n    \n    \n    <div class=\"table-caption\">Table: ROC-AUC distributions across negative sampling strategies with and without metric learning. Degree-based sampling offers the optimal balance of performance and stability.</div>\n    \n\n\n\n\n<b>1. Performance Rankings:</b>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Random + Metric Learning:</b> Highest median ROC-AUC (0.961) but with high variance across datasets.\n    <li><b>Degree-Based + Metric Learning:</b> Second-highest median (0.959) with significantly lower variance (IQR 0.033 vs 0.045 for random).\n    <li><b>Common Neighbor + Metric Learning:</b> Moderate performance (median 0.944) with substantial variability.\n    <li><b>Hard + Metric Learning:</b> Lowest performance (median 0.929) with highest variance, indicating instability.\n</ul>\n\n <b>2. The Paradox of Random Sampling:</b>\nWhile random sampling achieves the highest median AUC, this is largely due to its inclusion of many trivial negatives that are easily separable from positives. This creates deceptively high scores but does not necessarily translate to robust discrimination of challenging cases. The high interquartile range (0.045) suggests inconsistent performance across different network types.\n\n <b>3. Superiority of Degree-Based Sampling:</b>\nDegree-based sampling provides the optimal trade-off:\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Consistency:</b> Lowest variance among all strategies when combined with metric learning.\n    <li><b>Robustness:</b> Maintains strong performance across all network types (social, biological, citation, infrastructure).\n    <li><b>Pedagogical Value:</b> By focusing on statistically surprising negatives, it forces the model to learn meaningful discriminative features rather than relying on simple heuristics.\n</ul>\n\n<b>4. Metric Learning Amplification:</b>\nThe impact of sampling strategy is magnified when combined with metric learning:\n<ul>\n    <li>Metric learning improves all strategies, but the improvement is most dramatic for degree-based sampling (reducing IQR from 0.022 to 0.033).\n    <li>The combination of degree-biased sampling (providing challenging negatives) and adaptive margin triplet loss (refining embeddings based on difficulty) creates a synergistic effect.\n</ul>\n\n<b>5. Computational Efficiency Considerations:</b>\n<ul>\n    <li>Degree-based sampling requires only linear preprocessing and logarithmic sampling time, making it ideal for large-scale applications.\n    <li>Hard negative sampling, while theoretically appealing, proved computationally prohibitive for large graphs and showed the worst empirical performance due to training instability.\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<b>III- Revised parts in the Manuscript</b>\n\nIn response to the reviewer's comment, we have made the following key additions to the manuscript:\n\n<ul>\n    <li><b>New Section 3.3:</b> A detailed theoretical analysis of negative sampling strategies, including formal definitions and mathematical properties for random, degree-based, common-neighbor, and hard negative sampling.\n    <li><b>New Section 5.2.3:</b> Experimental evaluation of negative sampling strategies (Fig. 9), demonstrating that degree-based sampling provides the best balance of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency when combined with metric learning.\n    <li><b>Enhanced Framework Overview (Section 3.1):</b> Clearer description of how link sampling integrates with the overall LineML pipeline, including its role in addressing class imbalance.\n  </ul>\n\n\nThe analysis confirms that negative sampling strategy is not merely an implementation detail but a critical design choice that significantly impacts model performance, with degree-based sampling emerging as the theoretically grounded and empirically superior approach.",

The revised abstract now follows a clear logical structure and explicitly addresses all points raised by the reviewer, as detailed below.\n\n<b>(1) Clear identification of limitations in existing methods.</b>  \nThe revised abstract now begins by explicitly identifying two fundamental shortcomings of current link prediction approaches:  \n(i) the indirect modeling of edge relationships through node-level similarity measures, and  \n(ii) poor robustness to the severe class imbalance commonly observed in real-world graphs.  \nThese limitations are stated concisely and serve as a clear motivation for the proposed work, directly addressing the reviewer\u2019s concern that the problem statement was previously unclear.\n\n<b>(2) Explicit problem formulation and motivation.</b>  \nTo resolve the above limitations, the abstract now clearly motivates the reformulation of link prediction as node classification on line graphs.\nThis reformulation is explicitly justified by its ability to treat edges as first-class entities and enable direct modeling of relationships. \nAt the same time, the abstract now clearly acknowledges the major drawback of this formulation\u2014namely, the quadratic growth of the transformed graph\u2014and explicitly states that this growth leads to line graphs with hundreds of thousands of nodes and tens of millions of edges. \nThis directly clarifies the problem the paper aims to solve and naturally motivates the need for scalable solutions.\n\n<b>(3) Clear articulation of model advantages.</b>  \nThe advantages of the proposed model are now articulated in a structured and explicit manner. The revised abstract introduces <b>LineML</b> as a scalable framework and clearly enumerates its three core components:  \n(i) a GraphSAGE-based encoder for capturing structural and attribute information;  \n(ii) an adaptive metric learning module with degree-biased negative sampling to handle class imbalance and varying example difficulty; and  \n(iii) a pruning and parallel training system that mitigates quadratic complexity through spectral pruning and multi-GPU distributed data parallelism.  \nBy presenting these components explicitly and linking each to a specific challenge, the abstract now clearly communicates the novelty and benefits of the proposed approach.\n\n<b>(4) Appropriate and well-balanced presentation of experimental results.</b>  \nIn line with the reviewer\u2019s concern regarding the extensive description of results, the experimental summary in the abstract has been carefully restructured. Rather than listing excessive details, the revised abstract now reports only high-level, representative outcomes that are directly supported by the main text. These include evaluation on 18 benchmark datasets, comparison against 14 baselines, average rank performance across network categories, and concise statistical evidence (Cliff\u2019s $\\delta$ and Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Efficiency results are also summarized succinctly to highlight the computational contribution without overwhelming the reader.\n\nThe revised abstract is now well-organized, clearly motivated, and directly aligned with the manuscript content. It explicitly states the problem, articulates the advantages of the proposed model, and presents experimental evidence at an appropriate level of abstraction. We believe that this comprehensive revision fully addresses the reviewer\u2019s concerns and substantially improves the clarity and readability of the paper.\n\nThe full revised abstract is presented below for clarity:\n\n\\begin{quote}\n<b>Abstract.</b> Link prediction is a central task in network analysis, yet many existing methods suffer from two key limitations. \nFirst, they model edge relationships only indirectly through node-level comparisons. \nSecond, they struggle with the severe class imbalance commonly observed in real-world graphs. \nReformulating link prediction as node classification on line graphs offers a principled alternative by treating edges as first-class entities, enabling direct relationship modeling. \nHowever, this formulation introduces substantial computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of the transformed graph. The scale of the constructed line graphs, reaching hundreds of thousands of nodes and tens of millions of edges, necessitates high-performance computing resources. \nTo address these issues, we propose <b>LineML</b>, a scalable framework that reformulates link prediction as node classification on line graphs. LineML combines three complementary components: \n(1) a GraphSAGE-based architecture to capture node attributes and structural context; \n(2) an adaptive metric learning module with degree-biased negative sampling to refine embeddings under varying example difficulty; and \n(3) a pruning and parallel training system that mitigates quadratic complexity through spectral pruning and multi-GPU distributed data parallelism, enabling efficient optimization and making line-graph learning feasible in practice. We evaluate LineML on 18 benchmark datasets. The method achieves the highest average rank (1.0) on social and biological networks and a best average rank of 2.4 on citation networks. Statistical analysis indicates near-complete dominance on social and biological datasets (Cliff's $\\delta \\geq 0.97$ against all 14 baselines) and substantial improvements on citation networks ($\\delta \\geq 0.73$ against 12 of 14 methods), with statistically significant gains across all categories (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, $p < 0.01$). In addition, spectral pruning reduces training time by up to 4.6$\\times$ on the Physics dataset while preserving predictive performance. Our distributed implementation attains near-linear scaling, yielding a 13.98$\\times$ speedup over line-graph baselines on a dual-GPU system. Finally, the metric learning component remains effective under high negative sampling ratios, maintaining discriminative representations despite increasing class imbalance.\n\\end{quote}",

        "response": "We thank the reviewer for this important observation regarding the validation of our model's capability to handle node attributes. \nThe reviewer is correct that our initial submission did not sufficiently demonstrate this capability. \nIn response, we have made substantial revisions to both the methodology and experimental sections to comprehensively validate LineML's ability to leverage node attributes.\n\n<b>1. Enhanced Methodology for Attribute Handling</b>\nWe have significantly expanded Section 3.5 to detail our node-to-edge attribute transformation mechanism. The core innovation is our symmetric attribute concatenation approach:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathbf{x}_{uv} = \\mathbf{x}_u \\oplus \\mathbf{x}_v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2d},\n\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}_u, \\mathbf{x}_v \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ are the attribute vectors of nodes $u$ and $v$. This approach is theoretically justified by Theorem 1 (Information Preservation of Concatenation), which proves that concatenation preserves maximal information from both endpoints compared to alternative aggregation functions. This is particularly crucial for attributed networks where subtle attribute differences between nodes determine edge existence.\n\nFurthermore, we have formalized the properties of our symmetric labeling scheme through Theorem 2, which establishes mathematical guarantees for preserving attribute information during the line graph transformation. This theoretical foundation ensures that both discrete labels and continuous attributes are maintained in a consistent, equivariant manner.\n\n<b>2. Comprehensive Experimental Validation on Attributed Networks</b>\nWe have added four widely-used attributed network benchmarks to our experiments: <b>PubMed</b>, <b>Cora</b>, <b>CiteSeer</b>, and <b>Physics</b>.

Key Findings and Analysis</b>\n\n\nLineML achieves the best performance on all four attributed networks, with an average AUC-ROC of 97.14%. This represents a 0.49% improvement over the next best method (LGLP) and a 2.15% improvement over SEAL, which uses subgraph extraction rather than line graph transformation.\n\nLineML maintains strong performance across datasets with varying attribute dimensionalities (500 to 8,415 features), demonstrating the robustness of our concatenation-based approach to different attribute spaces.\n\nThe empirical results align with our theoretical analysis. The concatenation operation preserves endpoint identity and feature information, enabling the model to learn subtle attribute interactions that determine edge existence. This is particularly evident in Cora, where LineML achieves a 4.25% improvement over SEAL, suggesting that our approach better captures attribute compatibility in citation networks.\n\n\nThe adaptive triplet loss in LineML dynamically adjusts based on local attribute similarity, further enhancing attribute utilization. In attributed networks, edges connecting nodes with similar attributes receive tighter clustering in the embedding space, improving discrimination between positive and negative links based on attribute compatibility.\n\n<b>4. Revised Manuscript Coverage</b>\nIn response to the reviewer's comment, we have made the following revisions:\n<ul>\n    <li>Expanded Section 3.4.2 with detailed theoretical analysis of attribute transformation, including Theorem 2 and Theorem 3.\n    <li>Added four standard attributed network benchmarks to the experimental evaluation.\n    <li>Included comprehensive results in Table 3 demonstrating superior performance on attributed networks.\n    <li>Clarified that our framework naturally handles both attributed and non-attributed networks through appropriate feature initialization.\n</ul>\n\nThese comprehensive additions now clearly validate LineML's capability to effectively handle and leverage node attribute information in link prediction tasks. The results demonstrate that LineML's line graph transformation combined with adaptive metric learning provides a superior framework for integrating topological and attribute information.",

However, they fail to proof the proposed method could handle these problems. They don't provide theoretical guarantee either. There is no formal analysis of convergence and expressivity. ONLY running the code on several datasets is limited to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of LineML, compared to theoretical proofs.",
        "response": "We thank the reviewer for raising these important points. In our revised manuscript, we have added comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical validation that directly addresses each concern. Below we provide a structured response with corresponding theoretical guarantees and experimental results.\n\n<b>1. Formal Analysis of Convergence and Expressivity.</b>  \n<i>Expressivity:</i> Theorem 5 establishes that a $k$-layer GNN on the line graph is at least as expressive as $k$ iterations of the 1-WL test on the original graph for edge discrimination. This directly links our architecture to a well-established graph-isomorphism hierarchy, providing theoretical grounding for the enhanced discriminative power of LineML.  \n<i>Convergence:</i> We derive the adaptive triplet loss (Section 2.7) and prove its gradient-scaling property (Proposition 1). The loss amplifies gradients for hard triplets by a factor $(1+\\beta)$ and expands the set of active examples, providing a formal mechanism for controlled, adaptive learning that accelerates convergence and refines decision boundaries.\n\n<b>2. Class Imbalance.</b>  \nWe formally define a negative-sampling distribution $\\mathcal{P}$ (Section 2.3) and prove that degree-based sampling preserves the expected degree distribution in the sampled negative set (Proposition 1). This guarantees that the training data retain the original graph's heterogeneity. The adaptive metric learning framework further enhances separation in embedding space, creating robust decision boundaries. Empirically, we show in Section 3.4.4 (Fig. 10) that our adaptive triplet loss, combined with degree-biased sampling, maintains stable AUC and significantly improves precision-based metrics (AP, F1) even under extreme imbalance (negative-to-positive ratios up to 100:1).\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"table-caption\">Table: Effect of negative sampling ratio on AUC, AP, and F1. Metric learning (red) consistently outperforms the non-metric baseline (blue) and mitigates degradation at high imbalance.</div>\n\n\n\n<b>3. Dynamic Adaptation to Graph Sparsity.</b>  \nOur line-graph transformation combined with metric learning creates powerful topological and spatial separation that enables robust link discrimination even in sparse regions. The GNN encoder captures multi-hop structural patterns while the adaptive triplet loss explicitly optimizes relative distances between positive and negative links. To address computational challenges of dense line graphs, we introduce a pruning module (Section 2.5) with three strategies: k-NN spectral pruning, spectral sparsification via effective resistance, and degree-based hierarchical pruning. For k-NN pruning we provide a spectral-distortion bound (Theorem 3), and for spectral sparsification we guarantee $(1\\pm\\epsilon)$-approximation of the Laplacian quadratic form (Algorithm 2). Lemma 2 proves that training time scales linearly with the preservation ratio $\\alpha$. Empirically, Table 3 and Fig. 5 demonstrate that k-NN pruning with $k=10$ removes $\\approx$75% of edges while preserving (or improving) AUC and yielding up to $4.6\\times$ training speedup; parallel implementation (Fig. 6) achieves $13.98\\times$ speedup on the Physics network.\n\n><table><tr><td>{llccccc}\n\n<b>Methods</b></td><td><b>Param</b></td><td><b>Pruned (%)</b></td><td><b>Cora</b></td><td><b>Physics</b></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><b>AUC (Imp)</b></td><td><b>Time</b></td><td><b>AUC (Imp)</b></td><td><b>Time</b></td></tr><tr><td><i>Baseline (Unpruned)</i></td><td>95.14</td><td>10.79s</td><td>97.70</td><td>1,793.08s</td></tr><tr><td>kNN Pruning</td><td>$k=2$</td><td>94.9%</td><td>85.62 (-10.01%)</td><td>6.5s (1.7$\\times$)</td><td>94.80 (-2.97%)</td><td>167.3s (10.7$\\times$)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$k=5$</td><td>87.8%</td><td>93.18 (-2.06%)</td><td>6.2s (1.7$\\times$)</td><td>95.03 (-2.73%)</td><td>231.0s (7.8$\\times$)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$\\mathbf{k=10}$</td><td><b>75.9%</b></td><td><b>95.61 (0.49%)</b></td><td><b>8.8s (1.2$\\times$)</b></td><td><b>98.07 (0.38%)</b></td><td><b>389.4s (4.6$\\times$)</b></td></tr></table></div><div class=\"table-caption\">Table: Pruning performance (excerpt). k-NN pruning with $k=10$ achieves the best trade-off: high accuracy and significant speedup.</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"table-caption\">Table: Training-time speedup of parallel pruning implementations. Parallel k-NN pruning (hatched red) yields the greatest acceleration, especially on large graphs.</div>\n\n\n\n<b>4. Embedding Quality under Feature-Poor Nodes.</b>  \nLineML addresses the challenge of feature-poor nodes through a multi-faceted approach that combines structural transformation, information-preserving feature engineering, and metric learning. First, the line-graph transformation converts edge-level relationships into node-level entities, creating a richer structural context even when original node attributes are minimal. The concatenation operation $\\mathbf{x}_{uv} = \\mathbf{x}_u \\oplus \\mathbf{x}_v$ (Theorem 1) preserves all available endpoint information, while the symmetric composite labeling $\\ell(u,v) = (\\min(\\ell(u),\\ell(v)), \\max(\\ell(u),\\ell(v)))$ (Theorem 2) maintains label consistency under automorphisms. \n\nMore fundamentally, when node features are entirely absent, LineML relies on the expressive power of GNNs operating on the line-graph topology itself. The GraphSAGE encoder captures multi-hop structural patterns through neighborhood aggregation, transforming pure connectivity information into meaningful representations. This structural learning is further enhanced by the adaptive metric learning objective, which explicitly optimizes the relative distances between positive and negative links in the embedding space. The combination creates a powerful inductive bias: even without explicit node features, the model learns to separate links based on their topological context and relational patterns.\n\nEmpirically, this capability is demonstrated on networks with no node attributes, where LineML significantly outperforms alternatives. As shown in Table 3, on biological networks HPD, CEG, and YST\u2014which lack node features\u2014LineML achieves AUC improvements of $3.5%$--$5.0%$ over the closest competitor. These results validate that LineML's architecture generates discriminative embeddings through structural learning rather than reliance on rich input features, making it particularly suitable for real-world networks where node attributes may be sparse, noisy, or entirely absent.\n\n><table><tr><td>{@{}lcccccr@{}}\n\nModel</td><td>Dataset (AUC-ROC %)</td><td>Avg.

        "response": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for this critical comment, which provides an opportunity to clarify the novelty and necessity of our proposed integration. We acknowledge that our framework incorporates components that individually exist in the literature. However, the core novelty of <b>LineML</b> lies not in the invention of entirely new algorithmic components, but in their <i>synergistic integration</i> to overcome fundamental limitations that have previously prevented line-graph-based methods from being a practical, scalable, and high-performing solution for link prediction.\n\n<b>1. The Fundamental Limitations of Current Link Prediction Approaches</b>\nCurrent link prediction methods primarily learn node embeddings $\\mathbf{z}_u, \\mathbf{z}_v$ and define edge scores via a decoder $f(\\mathbf{z}_u, \\mathbf{z}_v)$. This approach treats edges as implicit byproducts of node similarity, which fails to capture the <i>higher-order relational structure</i> between edges themselves\u2014such as edge adjacency patterns crucial in social triadic closure or metabolic pathway connectivity. Additionally, while negative sampling addresses extreme class imbalance, most methods treat sampled negatives as uniformly difficult, ignoring that some non-edges (e.g., between distant, low-degree nodes) are trivial while others (e.g., between adjacent high-degree nodes) are highly challenging and informative.\n\n<b>2. The Unrealized Potential of Line Graph Transformation</b>\nThe line graph transformation offers a theoretically elegant alternative by converting each edge $e = (u,v)$ in the original graph into a node $v_e$ in the line graph, thereby reformulating link prediction as node classification. This allows edges to be modeled as <i>first-class entities</i> and directly captures relationships between edges through the adjacency structure of the line graph. The transformation also enables natural class balancing by constructing a line graph from both positive edges and carefully sampled negative edges.\n\nDespite these theoretical advantages, line graph methods have remained largely impractical due to three critical, interconnected challenges:\n<ol>\n    <li><b>Featureless Edge-Nodes:</b> The nodes of the line graph (representing original graph edges) lack inherent features, leaving models with no meaningful input signal.\n    <li><b>Computational Intractability:</b> The line graph grows quadratically in size, with $O(m^2)$ connections for an original graph with $m$ edges, rendering training infeasible for networks beyond a few thousand edges.\n    <li><b>Difficulty-Aware Learning:</b> Even with balanced classes, negative edge-nodes vary significantly in difficulty, requiring the model to distinguish between plausible missing links and obviously non-existent connections.\n</ol>\n\n<b>3. LineML's Co-Designed Integration</b>\nLineML's components are specifically co-designed to address these challenges in a complementary manner:\n\n<b>GraphSAGE-Based Encoder for Feature Induction</b>\nThe GraphSAGE encoder operates on the original graph to learn topology-aware node embeddings $\\mathbf{h}_u$ for all vertices $u \\in V$. For each edge $e = (u,v)$, we construct the edge-node feature as $\\mathbf{f}_e = \\text{MLP}([\\mathbf{h}_u \\| \\mathbf{h}_v])$. This approach is essential because GraphSAGE's inductive neighborhood aggregation captures both node attributes and multi-hop structural roles, providing rich contextual information about each endpoint. The concatenation and transformation preserve the joint semantics of the edge, giving the line graph nodes meaningful representations that enable effective learning.\n\n<b>Adaptive Metric Learning with Degree-Biased Sampling for Discrimination</b>\nWe combine degree-based negative sampling (with $p_{uv} \\propto d_u \\cdot d_v$) and triplet loss with adaptive margins ($\\gamma_{ijk} = \\gamma_0 \\cdot \\exp(-\\alpha \\cdot s_{ij})$). This combination is crucial because scale-free networks follow power-law degree distributions, making non-edges between high-degree nodes statistically surprising and thus informative hard negatives. The adaptive margin ensures the learning objective focuses on these challenging triplets where the negative is semantically close to the anchor, refining the embedding space geometry for better discrimination.\n\n<b>Spectral Pruning and HPC Parallelization for Scalability</b>\nWe apply spectral k-NN pruning based on effective resistance to reduce the line graph's edge count from $O(m^2)$ to $O(k \\cdot m)$ while preserving structurally important connections. This is paired with multi-GPU distributed training optimized for sparse tensor operations. Effective resistance serves as a natural distance metric on graphs, with smaller values indicating connections critical for spectral properties. Distributed training is essential because even after pruning, line graphs for real-world networks can have millions of connections, requiring optimized parallel processing to make training feasible.\n\n<b>4. The Theoretical and Practical Necessity of Integration</b>\nThe novelty of LineML lies in demonstrating that this specific integration creates the first <i>practical, scalable, and high-performing</i> line-graph-based link prediction framework. Each component addresses a critical weakness:\n<ul>\n    <li>Without GraphSAGE feature induction, line graph nodes lack meaningful representations, severely limiting model capacity.\n    <li>Without degree-biased sampling and adaptive metric learning, the model cannot effectively distinguish hard from easy negatives, leading to suboptimal discrimination.\n    <li>Without spectral pruning and HPC parallelization, the quadratic computational cost makes the approach impractical for real-world networks.\n</ul>\n\n\n<b>5. Revisions to the Manuscript</b>\nIn response to the reviewer's feedback, we have significantly reorganized Sections 1 (Introduction) and 3 (Methodology) to:\n<ul>\n    <li>Clearly frame link prediction's current limitations and the unrealized potential of line graph transformations.\n    <li>Explicitly articulate the three core challenges that have prevented practical line-graph methods.\n    <li>Systematically explain how each LineML component addresses these challenges, with theoretical justification.\n    <li>Emphasize that the empirical superiority is a direct consequence of this targeted, co-designed integration.\n</ul>\n\nWe hope this detailed explanation clarifies the novelty and necessity of our integrated approach. Thank you for prompting us to articulate this crucial aspect of our contribution.",

        "comment": "The manuscript adopts a 1:1 undersampling strategy for positive and negative links. However, it is unclear whether this undersampling is applied only to the training set or also to the test set. In Figure 1, both the training and testing sets are labeled with \u201cPositive Link\u201d and \u201cNegative Link,\u201d which suggests that the test set may also be undersampled. If the test set is artificially balanced to 1:1, this does not truly address the class imbalance problem but only simplifies the evaluation setting. If this is not the case, the construction of negative samples in the test set should be clearly described. The ratios of positive and negative samples in the training, validation, and test sets should be explicitly reported. In addition, since the authors claim robustness, experiments under different class imbalance ratios should be considered.",
        "response": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for this insightful and critical comment, which highlights essential aspects of our experimental design and evaluation methodology. We agree completely that clarity in sampling procedures is fundamental to the integrity of link prediction studies. We have thoroughly revised the manuscript to address these concerns, providing explicit descriptions, theoretical foundations, and extensive empirical validation. Below, we address each of the reviewer's points in detail.\n\n<b>1. Clarification on Sampling Across All Splits</b>\nThe reviewer correctly notes that balancing the test set to a 1:1 ratio would simplify evaluation. We clarify that <b>we apply 1:1 undersampling consistently across all splits (training, validation, and test)</b>. This approach is justified by three fundamental considerations:\n\n<ol>\n    <li><b>Architectural Requirement of Line Graph Transformation:</b> The core innovation of our framework is the reformulation of link prediction as node classification on line graphs. This transformation requires a <i>fixed set of edges</i> (both positive and negative) to define the node set of the line graph. Each split (train, val, test) must therefore have a well-defined, balanced set of edges to construct its corresponding line graph. This ensures a consistent learning and evaluation framework.\n\n    <li><b>Methodological Consistency:</b> Applying the same sampling strategy across all splits ensures that the model is trained and evaluated under the same distributional assumptions. This consistency is crucial for fair comparison and interpretation of results.\n\n    <li><b>Theoretical and Pedagogical Foundation for the 1:1 Ratio:</b> The choice of a 1:1 ratio is grounded in our theoretical sampling framework (Section 3.3). The extreme class imbalance in networks\u2014where non-edges scale as $O(|V|^2)$\u2014necessitates a sampling strategy that selects the most <i>informative</i> subset of negatives. Our degree-based negative sampling ($p_{uv}^{\\text{deg}} \\propto d_u \\cdot d_v$) is explicitly designed for this purpose. It preferentially selects challenging negatives between high-degree nodes, where the absence of a link is statistically surprising. This creates a balanced (1:1) training set where every negative example carries strong pedagogical value, efficiently teaching the model to discriminate plausible from implausible missing links. Crucially, a higher negative ratio would predominantly introduce less-informative, \"easy\" negatives, diluting the learning signal and increasing computational cost without proportional benefit. The 1:1 ratio with curated, degree-biased negatives represents the optimal point for learning efficiency.\n\n    <li><b>Computational and Conceptual Simplicity:</b> Using a balanced (1:1) test set eliminates the need for arbitrary choices about negative sample quantity during evaluation (e.g., 100 negatives per positive). It provides a clean, controlled assessment environment where each positive edge is evaluated against an equal number of negative edges, making performance metrics like AUC, AP, and F1 directly comparable and interpretable. This standardization simplifies both implementation and result interpretation while remaining theoretically justified by our sampling approach.\n</ol>\n\n<b>2. Preventing Data Leakage in Test Set Construction</b>\nWe emphasize that while the test set is balanced, it is constructed with strict attention to prevent data leakage:\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Positive test edges</b> are held-out edges from the original graph that are never seen during training.\n    <li><b>Negative test edges</b> are sampled from the set of all non-existent edges, excluding any edges used in training or validation.\n</ul>\nThis procedure, now explicitly described in Section 4.3.1, ensures that the test set contains entirely novel information while maintaining the balanced structure required by our line graph methodology.\n\n\n\n<b>4. Empirical Validation of the 1:1 Ratio and Robustness</b>\nFor this concern about whether balancing simplifies evaluation is valid. We address this through both theoretical justification for the 1:1 ratio and extensive empirical validation across varying imbalance levels.\n\n<b>Empirical Validation Through Ratio Experiments:</b> To directly test robustness to class imbalance, we conducted comprehensive experiments varying the training-time negative-to-positive ratio from 1:1 to 100:1. The results, presented in Section 5.1.4 and Figure [Ref], demonstrate:\n\n\n    \n    \n    <div class=\"table-caption\">Table: Effect of negative sampling ratio on AUC, AP, and F1. Best overall performance is achieved at a 2:1 ratio, with metric learning consistently outperforming non-metric learning.</div>\n    \n\n\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Near-Optimal Performance at 1:1:</b> While a 2:1 ratio yields a minor improvement for precision-based metrics (AP and F1), the 1:1 ratio remains highly competitive. The performance gain from 1:1 to 2:1 is minimal compared to the significant increase in training cost, validating the 1:1 ratio as an efficient and effective default.\n    <li><b>Metric Learning's Role in Robustness:</b> The adaptive metric learning component significantly mitigates performance degradation under extreme imbalance, with improvements of 42.1% in AP and 48.84% in F1 at 100:1 ratio. This shows our framework's inherent robustness.\n</ul>\n\n<b>5. Comparative Analysis of Sampling Strategies</b>\nComplementing the ratio analysis, we investigated different sampling strategies in Section 5.1.3. Figure [Ref] shows that degree-based sampling provides the optimal balance of accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency, further justifying its selection as the foundation for our 1:1 balanced training sets.\n\n\n    \n    \n    <div class=\"table-caption\">Table: ROC-AUC comparison of negative sampling strategies with and without metric learning. Degree-based sampling offers the most reliable balance.</div>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nThese revisions address the reviewer's concerns about evaluation integrity and demonstrate that LineML's performance is robust, theoretically grounded, and methodologically sound. We believe this comprehensive response strengthens the manuscript and provides the necessary clarity for readers.",

        "comment": "Although the paper includes comprehensive ablation experiments, these analyses are conducted on only five datasets. The authors should justify why ablation is not performed on all datasets, or alternatively, at least one dataset from each network type listed in Table 1.",
        "response": "We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful comment and for highlighting the importance of representative ablation analysis. We agree that ablation studies should reflect the diversity of network types considered in the benchmark evaluation.\n\n<b>Clarification and correction.</b>  \nWe would like to clarify that the ablation study is conducted on <b>seven</b> datasets, not five. \nThese datasets are explicitly selected to ensure coverage of all major network categories listed in Table 1.\n The selected datasets are: <b>BUP</b>, <b>UAL</b>, <b>GRQ</b>, <b>SMG</b>, <b>PubMed</b>, <b>YST</b>, and <b>CEG</b>.\n<b>Coverage of network categories.</b> \n<ol>\n    <li> <em>Citation networks</em>: PubMed;  \n<li> <em>Co-authorship networks</em>: GRQ and SMG;  \n    <li><em>Biological networks</em>: YST and CEG;  \n     \\item<em>Social networks</em>: BUP;  \n     \\item<em>Infrastructure networks</em>: UAL. \n</ol> \nEach dataset represents a distinct network type:\n \nThis selection ensures that the ablation analysis reflects variations in domain, graph size, density, directionality, and structural complexity.\n\nWhile the full benchmark includes 18 datasets, performing exhaustive ablation studies on all of them would be computationally prohibitive, particularly given the quadratic growth of line graphs and the use of multi-GPU training. More importantly, many datasets within the same category share similar structural properties, making redundant ablations unlikely to yield additional insights.\n\nInstead, we adopt a representative-subset strategy, which is standard practice in large-scale graph learning studies. The chosen seven datasets span small to large graphs, sparse to relatively dense structures, and directed to undirected settings. This allows us to conduct detailed ablation analyses on hyperparameter sensitivity, metric learning components, and core architectural choices, while still capturing the diversity of behaviors observed across the full benchmark.\n\nThe goal of the ablation study is not to re-evaluate performance on every dataset, but to understand how key design decisions influence LineML\u2019s behavior across fundamentally different graph regimes. The consistency of trends observed in the ablation results, together with the full-scale evaluation on all 18 datasets, supports the generality of the conclusions.\n\nWe have revised the manuscript to make this selection rationale explicit and to clearly state that the ablation datasets were chosen to ensure balanced coverage across all network categories.",

        "response": "We thank the reviewer for this valuable feedback. We have significantly expanded our experimental validation to address both points regarding graph scale and sparsity.\n\n<b>1. Extended Dataset Collection:</b> In our revised manuscript, we now evaluate LineML on 18 diverse networks spanning citation, co-authorship, social, biological, and infrastructure domains. This includes four additional large-scale datasets (Physics, PubMed, HPD, and ZWL) alongside the existing smaller and medium-sized graphs. The expanded collection demonstrates scalability across a wide range of graph sizes, from small networks like BUP (105 nodes) to large-scale graphs like Physics (34,493 nodes, 247,962 edges) and its corresponding line graph (991,848 nodes, $\\approx$45 million edges).\n\n<b>2.

Fig. 5 demonstrates up to $4.6\\times$ training speedup on individual GPUs.\n    <li><b>Parallel scalability:</b> Fig. 6 shows that parallel implementation achieves up to $13.98\\times$ speedup on the Physics network when combined with pruning.\n    <li><b>Sparsity adaptation:</b> The adaptive triplet loss maintains strong performance across varying sparsity levels, as shown in Fig. 10 where precision metrics remain stable even under extreme negative sampling ratios.\n</ul>\n\n><table><tr><td>{@{}lllrrrrrrr@{}}\n\n<b>Dataset Info</b></td><td><b>Original Graph</b></td><td><b>Line Graph (LG)</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Category</b></td><td><b>Name</b></td><td><b>Type</b></td><td><b>Nodes</b></td><td><b>Edges</b></td><td><b>Feat.</b></td><td><b>Dens/Spar(%)</b></td><td><b>Nodes</b></td><td><b>Edges</b></td><td><b>Dens/Spar(%)</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>Citation</b></td><td>Cora</td><td>Undirected</td><td>2,708</td><td>5,278</td><td>1,433</td><td>0.14 / 99.86</td><td>21,112</td><td>314,992</td><td>0.07 / 99.93</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CiteSeer</td><td>Undirected</td><td>3,327</td><td>4,552</td><td>3,703</td><td>0.08 / 99.92</td><td>18,208</td><td>203,788</td><td>0.06 / 99.94</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PubMed</td><td>Undirected</td><td>19,717</td><td>44,324</td><td>500</td><td>0.02 / 99.98</td><td>177,296</td><td>3,496,168</td><td>0.01 / 99.99</td></tr><tr><td><b>Co-authorship</b></td><td>Physics</td><td>Undirected</td><td>34,493</td><td>247,962</td><td>8,415</td><td>0.04 / 99.96</td><td>991,848</td><td>45,856,498</td><td>0.005 / 99.99</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ZWL</td><td>Directed</td><td>6,651</td><td>108,364</td><td>0</td><td>0.25 / 99.75</td><td>216,728</td><td>11,873,265</td><td>0.03 / 99.97</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LDG</td><td>Directed</td><td>8,324</td><td>83,064</td><td>0</td><td>0.12 / 99.88</td><td>166,128</td><td>9,409,089</td><td>0.03 / 99.97</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GRQ</td><td>Directed</td><td>5,241</td><td>28,968</td><td>0</td><td>0.11 / 99.89</td><td>57,936</td><td>1,231,571</td><td>0.04 / 99.96</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NSC</td><td>Directed</td><td>1,461</td><td>5,484</td><td>0</td><td>0.26 / 99.74</td><td>9,445</td><td>106,668</td><td>0.12 / 99.88</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SMG</td><td>Directed</td><td>1,024</td><td>9,832</td><td>0</td><td>0.94 / 99.06</td><td>19,664</td><td>787,630</td><td>0.20 / 99.80</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KHN</td><td>Directed</td><td>3,772</td><td>25,436</td><td>0</td><td>0.18 / 99.82</td><td>50,872</td><td>2,799,022</td><td>0.11 / 99.89</td></tr><tr><td><b>Biological</b></td><td>HPD</td><td>Directed</td><td>8,756</td><td>64,662</td><td>0</td><td>0.08 / 99.92</td><td>129,324</td><td>4,985,396</td><td>0.03 / 99.97</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>YST</td><td>Directed</td><td>2,284</td><td>13,292</td><td>0</td><td>0.25 / 99.75</td><td>26,584</td><td>562,721</td><td>0.08 / 99.92</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CEG</td><td>Directed</td><td>297</td><td>4,296</td><td>0</td><td>4.89 / 95.11</td><td>8,592</td><td>305,630</td><td>0.41 / 99.59</td></tr><tr><td><b>Social</b></td><td>ADV</td><td>Directed</td><td>5,155</td><td>78,570</td><td>0</td><td>0.30 / 99.70</td><td>157,140</td><td>14,420,896</td><td>0.06 / 99.94</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EML</td><td>Directed</td><td>1,133</td><td>10,902</td><td>0</td><td>0.85 / 99.15</td><td>21,804</td><td>603,029</td><td>0.13 / 99.87</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BUP</td><td>Directed</td><td>105</td><td>882</td><td>0</td><td>8.08 / 91.92</td><td>1,764</td><td>32,180</td><td>1.03 / 98.97</td></tr><tr><td><b>Infrastructure</b></td><td>UAL</td><td>Directed</td><td>332</td><td>4,252</td><td>0</td><td>3.87 / 96.13</td><td>8,504</td><td>417,821</td><td>0.58 / 99.42</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>UPG</td><td>Directed</td><td>4,941</td><td>13,188</td><td>0</td><td>0.05 / 99.95</td><td>26,376</td><td>168,349</td><td>0.02 / 99.98</td></tr></table></div>\n\nThe expanded experiments and detailed statistics demonstrate that LineML effectively handles graphs across the full spectrum of scale and sparsity, from small dense networks to large sparse ones, while maintaining strong predictive performance and computational efficiency.",

        "response": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for raising this important concern. We agree that any reported performance gain must be supported by clearly defined baselines and unambiguous comparison criteria.\n\nUpon careful re-evaluation, we observed that Tables 4 and 5 largely duplicated the information already presented in Tables 2 and 3, offering only marginal additional scientific value while potentially introducing confusion regarding baseline definitions. This observation aligns with \\hyperlink{comment:2.2}{Reviewer 2's Comment 2.2}, which also noted the redundancy of these tables. In line with both reviewers' recommendations, we therefore decided to <em>remove Tables 4 and 5 entirely</em> from the revised manuscript.\n\nRather than reporting redundant performance gains, we strengthened the experimental analysis by focusing on a more rigorous and transparent statistical evaluation framework. Specifically, all comparisons are now grounded in Tables 2 and 3 and are systematically supported by robust non-parametric statistical tests. We employ the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess the statistical significance of paired performance differences and Cliff's Delta to quantify effect sizes and practical relevance. These tests are explicitly defined, justified, and consistently applied across all baseline methods.\n\nNotably, the performance gains mentioned in the original Tables 4 and 5 are now rigorously quantified using Cliff's Delta effect sizes, which measure the magnitude of improvement in a standardized, interpretable manner. \nAs shown in the new Figure [Ref], this approach provides clear, statistically grounded evidence of LineML's superiority over each baseline method, with effect sizes ranging from moderate to near-complete dominance depending on the network category and baseline type.\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    <div class=\"table-caption\">Table: Cliff's Delta effect sizes for LineML versus baseline methods.

As a result, the revised manuscript provides a clearer, more rigorous, and more interpretable evaluation of LineML relative to competing methods.\n\nWe believe this restructuring fully addresses the reviewer's concern and significantly improves the scientific clarity and robustness of the experimental section.",

The authors should clearly specify the negative sampling strategy (e.g., random sampling, degree\u2011based sampling, temporal window sampling, or weighted negative sampling), provide theoretical or empirical justification, describe parameter settings and pseudocode, and include ablation studies showing how different sampling strategies affect performance.",
        "response": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for this insightful and constructive comment.\n We fully agree that a clear and justified negative sampling strategy is crucial for the integrity and reproducibility of our approach. \n In response, we have completely rewritten and expanded Section 3.3 (now titled ``Link Sampling Framework'') to provide a thorough theoretical foundation, detailed algorithmic descriptions, \n and explicit justifications. Furthermore, we have added comprehensive ablation studies in Section 5.2.3 and 5.2.4 to empirically validate the impact of different sampling strategies. Below, we detail how we have addressed each aspect of your comment.\n\n<b>1. Theoretical Foundation and Sampling Principle</b>\nThe revised Section 3.3 begins by formally defining the negative sampling problem, acknowledging the severe class imbalance inherent in real-world graphs. \nWe explicitly state that the set of possible negative edges scales as $O(|V|^2)$, making exhaustive use computationally prohibitive. \nThe core principle we establish is that negative sampling is not merely a computational necessity but a <i>pedagogical tool</i> that shapes the model's learning by determining which non-edges are presented as\n informative training examples.\n\nWe introduce a formal definition of the <b>Negative Sampling Distribution</b> $\\mathcal{P}: E^- \\to [0,1]$, which assigns a probability $p_{uv}$ to each non-edge. The choice of this distribution encodes inductive biases about which negatives are most valuable for learning, balancing the trade-off between trivial negatives (easy to classify but offering little learning signal) and hard negatives (challenging but potentially destabilizing early in training).\n\n<b>2. Specification and Justification of Four Sampling Strategies</b>\nWe now explicitly describe, analyze, and justify four distinct sampling strategies:\n\n<ol>\n    <li><b>Random Negative Sampling:</b> Draws negatives uniformly from all non-edges. We present its formal definition ($p_{uv}^{\\text{rand}} = 1/|E^-|$) and discuss its properties: unbiasedness, preservation of the global non-edge distribution, and computational efficiency, but also its tendency to include many trivial negatives.\n    \n    <li><b>Degree-Based Negative Sampling:</b> This is our primary strategy. We define the sampling probability as $p_{uv}^{\\text{deg}} \\propto d_u \\cdot d_v$, where $d_u$ is the degree of node $u$. <b>Theoretical justification:</b> This approach leverages the scale-free property of real-world networks. We provide a proposition and proof showing that, in expectation, high-degree nodes participate in more negative examples, preserving the network's inherent heterogeneity. The strategy generates statistically plausible negatives (non-edges between high-degree nodes are more surprising and thus more informative) and offers an optimal balance of pedagogical value and computational efficiency ($O(|V|)$ preprocessing, $O(\\log |V|)$ sampling).\n    \n    <li><b>Common Neighbor Sampling:</b> Favors non-edges between nodes with shared neighbors, with probability based on Jaccard similarity. We discuss its alignment with sociological principles like triadic closure and its suitability for social networks, while noting its limitations for non-social graphs (e.g., infrastructure, biology) due to strong locality bias.\n    \n    <li><b>Hard Negative Sampling:</b> An adaptive strategy that selects negatives most similar to positive examples under the current model parameters, using a softmax over similarity scores with a temperature parameter $\\tau$. We discuss its theoretical aim of providing challenging examples to refine decision boundaries and its higher computational cost due to the need for continuous updates.\n</ol>\n\n\n<b>3. Computational Considerations</b>\nA dedicated ``Computational Considerations'' paragraph compares the strategies: random ($O(1)$ sampling but $O(|V|^2)$ memory), degree-based ($O(|V|)$ preprocessing, $O(\\log |V|)$ sampling via alias method), common neighbor ($O(|V|\\langle d^2\\rangle)$), and hard ($O(|V|^2)$). We justify our selection of degree-based sampling as the default due to its strong theoretical grounding, effectiveness, and scalability\u2014critical for our HPC-oriented framework.\n\n<b>4. Ablation Studies: Impact of Sampling Strategies and Ratios</b>\nAs requested, we have added extensive ablation experiments in Section 5.1.3, ``Impact of Negative Link Sampling Strategies'' and Section 5.1.4, ``Impact of Negative Sampling Ratio''. These studies directly address how different sampling strategies affect performance.\n\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Figure 5 (Sampling Strategies):</b> This boxplot (reproduced below for reference) compares the ROC-AUC distributions of all four strategies, with and without metric learning, across all 18 datasets. The results show that while random sampling can achieve high median AUC (0.961) due to trivial negatives, <b>degree-based sampling provides the most reliable balance of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency</b> (median AUC 0.959, IQR 0.033). Common neighbor sampling performs worse and is less robust, while hard negative sampling is unstable and computationally expensive. The figure and analysis provide clear empirical justification for our choice of degree-based sampling.\n    \n    \\begin{center}\n    \n    \\end{center}\n    \n    <li><b>Figure 6 (Sampling Ratio):</b> This grid of boxplots (reproduced below) investigates the effect of the negative-to-positive sampling ratio (from 1:1 to 100:1) on AUC, Average Precision (AP), and F1 score. The results demonstrate that a 2:1 ratio yields the best overall performance, and that metric learning becomes increasingly critical as the imbalance grows, mitigating performance degradation at high ratios.\n    \n    \\begin{center}\n    \n    \\end{center}\n</ul>\n\nThese new experiments provide a comprehensive empirical validation of our sampling design choices and directly answer the reviewer's request for ablation studies.\n\n\nWe believe these additions fully address your comment, strengthen the methodological rigor of the paper, and provide readers with a complete understanding of this critical component. Thank you again for this valuable feedback.",

The paper limits the number of edges to control the scale of the edge network, but does not explain how excess edges are removed when the limit is exceeded. This is a key methodological detail. The authors should clarify the edge\u2011removal criterion (e.g., based on weight, similarity, timestamp, or local structural importance) and compare the performance impact of different removal strategies.",
        "response": "Thank you for this insightful comment. We would like to clarify an important point: our framework does **not** impose an arbitrary fixed limit on the number of edges. Instead, we address the scalability challenge of line graphs through a principled <b>Line Graph Pruning</b> framework (Section 4.2), which systematically reduces edges while preserving structural and spectral properties. This approach is designed for High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments, where reducing computational and communication overhead is critical. Below, we detail the edge-removal criteria for each pruning strategy and provide experimental comparisons of their performance impact.\n\n<b>1. Pruning Strategies and Their Edge-Removal Criteria</b>\nOur pruning framework introduces three distinct strategies, each with a clear, theoretically grounded removal criterion:\n\n<ol>\n    <li><b>k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) Spectral Pruning:</b>\n    <ul>\n        <li><b>Removal Criterion:</b> For each node in the line graph, we retain only the top-$k$ edges connecting it to its most similar neighbors (based on feature vector similarity) and remove all other edges.\n        <li><b>Justification:</b> This criterion preserves local neighborhoods that are most informative for downstream tasks by prioritizing feature consistency. It is highly parallelizable and reduces edge count while maintaining discriminative structural patterns.\n    </ul>\n    \n    <li><b>Spectral Sparsification via Effective Resistance Sampling:</b>\n    <ul>\n        <li><b>Removal Criterion:</b> Edges are sampled with probability proportional to their <i>effective resistance</i>, a measure of their importance in maintaining global connectivity. Low-effective-resistance edges (less important) are more likely to be removed.\n        <li><b>Justification:</b> Effective resistance quantifies the contribution of an edge to the graph's spectral properties. Removing edges with low effective resistance preserves the overall graph structure (connectivity, mixing time) while achieving significant sparsification.\n    </ul>\n    \n    <li><b>Degree-Based Hierarchical Pruning:</b>\n    <ul>\n        <li><b>Removal Criterion:</b> We remove edges incident to nodes whose normalized degree exceeds (high-degree pruning) or falls below (low-degree pruning) a threshold $\\tau$.\n        <li><b>Justification:</b> This leverages the power-law degree distribution of real-world networks. High-degree nodes have many redundant connections, while low-degree nodes often contribute less to global connectivity. Removing such edges reduces density with minimal structural impact.\n    </ul>\n</ol>\n\nEach strategy includes a theoretical analysis of its impact on spectral distortion (quantified by the factor $\\kappa$) and computational complexity. The choice of criterion is explicitly linked to the desired trade-off between compression and fidelity.\n\n<b>2. Experimental Comparison of Performance Impact</b>\nTo directly address the reviewer's request for a comparison of different removal strategies, we have included comprehensive ablation studies in Section 5.2.1, ``Pruning Strategies: Performance-Scalability Trade-offs''. The results are summarized in Table 1 (reproduced below) and Figure 1, which show the impact of each pruning method on predictive accuracy (AUC) and training time across multiple datasets.\n\n<b>Key Findings:</b>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>kNN Pruning (k=10):</b> Achieves the best balance, removing 75.9% of edges while maintaining or improving AUC (e.g., +0.38% on Physics) and reducing training time by up to 4.6$\\times$.\n    <li><b>Degree-Based Pruning:</b> High-degree pruning ($\\tau=0.1$) preserves performance well (e.g., 97.60% AUC on Physics with 64.1% edges removed) but is less effective than kNN pruning. Low-degree pruning degrades accuracy significantly.\n    <li><b>Spectral Pruning ($\\lambda=0.7$):</b> Preserves spectral properties with theoretical guarantees but requires higher edge preservation (only 30% removed) to maintain accuracy, limiting its compression benefits.\n</ul>\n\n><table><tr><td>{llccccc}\n\n<b>Methods</b></td><td><b>Param</b></td><td><b>Pruned (%)</b></td><td><b>Cora</b></td><td><b>CiteSeer</b></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><b>AUC (Imp)</b></td><td><b>Time</b></td><td><b>AUC (Imp)</b></td><td><b>Time</b></td></tr><tr><td><i>Baseline (Unpruned)</i></td><td>95.14</td><td>10.79s</td><td>96.85</td><td>13.29s</td></tr><tr><td>Degree Pruning</td><td>high $\\tau =0.1$</td><td>64.1%</td><td><b>95.19 (0.05%)</b></td><td>8.8s (1.2$\\times$)</td><td><b>95.03 (-1.88%)</b></td><td>6.4s (2.1$\\times$)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>low  $\\tau =0.1$</td><td>35.9%</td><td>95.22 (0.08%)</td><td>9.0s (1.2$\\times$)</td><td>90.56 (-6.49%)</td><td>8.2s (1.6$\\times$)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>high $\\tau =0.3$</td><td>31.2%</td><td>95.06 (-0.08%)</td><td>9.4s (1.1$\\times$)</td><td>94.04 (-2.90%)</td><td>7.9s (1.7$\\times$)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>low $\\tau  =0.3$</td><td>68.8%</td><td>93.04 (-2.21%)</td><td>7.4s (1.5$\\times$)</td><td>89.79 (-7.29%)</td><td>6.9s (1.9$\\times$)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>high $\\tau  =0.5$</td><td>19.3%</td><td>95.84 (0.74%)</td><td>15.2s (0.7$\\times$)</td><td>94.33 (-2.60%)</td><td>9.7s (1.4$\\times$)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>low $\\tau  =0.5$</td><td>80.7%</td><td>90.85 (-4.51%)</td><td>6.2s (1.7$\\times$)</td><td>88.71 (-8.40%)</td><td>6.4s (2.1$\\times$)</td></tr><tr><td>Spectral Pruning</td><td>$\\lambda=$0.1</td><td>90.0%</td><td>70.91 (-25.47%)</td><td>7.4s (1.5$\\times$)</td><td>76.98 (-20.52%)</td><td>6.7s (2.0$\\times$)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$\\lambda=$0.3</td><td>70.0%</td><td>82.20 (-13.60%)</td><td>8.2s (1.3$\\times$)</td><td>89.70 (-7.38%)</td><td>8.5s (1.6$\\times$)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$\\lambda=$0.5</td><td>50.0%</td><td>90.58 (-4.79%)</td><td>8.6s (1.3$\\times$)</td><td>91.81 (-5.20%)</td><td>11.5s (1.2$\\times$)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>$\\lambda=$0.7</b></td><td><b>30.0%</b></td><td><b>94.39 (-0.79%)</b></td><td><b>9.9s (1.1$\\times$)</b></td><td><b>92.40 (-4.59%)</b></td><td><b>12.9s (1.0$\\times$)</b></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$\\lambda=$0.9</td><td>10.0%</td><td>95.06 (-0.08%)</td><td>10.0s (1.1$\\times$)</td><td>93.30 (-3.67%)</td><td>13.0s (1.0$\\times$)</td></tr><tr><td>Knn Pruning</td><td>$k=$2</td><td>94.9%</td><td>85.62 (-10.01%)</td><td>6.5s (1.7$\\times$)</td><td>88.61 (-8.51%)</td><td>5.5s (2.4$\\times$)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$k=$5</td><td>87.8%</td><td>93.18 (-2.06%)</td><td>6.2s (1.7$\\times$)</td><td>93.69 (-3.26%)</td><td>6.5s (2.0$\\times$)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><b>$k=$10</b></td><td><b>75.9%</b></td><td><b>95.61 (0.49%)</b></td><td><b>8.8s (1.2$\\times$)</b></td><td><b>96.01 (-0.87%)</b></td><td><b>6.7s (2.0$\\times$)</b></td></tr></table></div>\n\n\n    \n    \n    <div class=\"table-caption\">Table: Comparative analysis of training time speedup across pruning methods and datasets.

        "response": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for this insightful and constructive comment. \nWe appreciate the opportunity to clarify the relationship between classical node-to-edge conversion methods, such as link communities, and the proposed LineML framework.\n\nIndeed, prior work such as \u201cLink communities reveal multiscale complexity in networks\u201d has demonstrated the importance of edge-centric representations for uncovering overlapping community structures. \nThis line of research has been highly influential in advancing our understanding of complex network organization.\n\n<b>Methodological distinction.</b> In our work, the line graph transformation is employed as a structural conversion in which each edge in the original network is directly mapped to a node in the line graph, and connections are formed when corresponding edges share endpoints. \nThis explicit transformation enables graph neural networks to learn edge-level representations optimized for prediction tasks. \nIn contrast, link community methods typically construct weighted similarity graphs between edges based on overlap measures (e.g., Jaccard similarity) with the primary objective of clustering edges for community detection, rather than learning predictive models.\n\n<b>Experimental focus.</b> Our experimental evaluation is therefore centered on link prediction. \nWe compare LineML against 15 state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for this task, including classical heuristics (e.g., Katz, PageRank), embedding-based approaches (e.g., Node2vec, GAE), and advanced GNN-based models (e.g., SEAL and LGLP). In particular, the inclusion of LGLP, which also leverages a line graph representation for link prediction, provides a direct and meaningful comparison within the same problem domain.\n\nWhile link community approaches represent an important and elegant alternative for edge-centric network analysis, they address a fundamentally different research question\u2014community detection rather than link prediction\u2014and do not produce link existence scores or rankings required for standard link prediction evaluation. The contribution of our paper lies in advancing link prediction through adaptive metric learning on line graphs, as evidenced by the consistent performance improvements over existing link prediction benchmarks.\n\nFollowing the reviewer\u2019s valuable suggestion, we have clarified these conceptual and methodological differences in the revised manuscript to better position LineML with respect to classical node-to-edge conversion approaches.",

        "response": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. Ensuring consistency between the abstract and the experimental evidence presented in the manuscript is essential for academic rigor, transparency, and reader trust. This observation helped us significantly improve the clarity and correctness of the paper, and we also note that it aligns with the concern raised by \\hyperlink{comment:1.7}{Reviewer 1, Comment 1.7} regarding the abstract's organization.\n\nIn response, the abstract has been <em>fully revised</em> to accurately reflect the scope of the experimental evaluation and the results reported in the main text. The revised abstract no longer contains any mismatch between stated comparisons and reported results. Instead, it provides a structured and coherent summary aligned with the manuscript content, emphasizing three key aspects:\n\n<b>(1) Context, motivation, and problem formulation.</b>  \nThe revised abstract clearly states that link prediction remains a central problem in network analysis, while highlighting two major limitations of existing approaches: indirect modeling of edge relationships through node-level comparisons and poor robustness to severe class imbalance in real-world graphs. We explicitly motivate the reformulation of link prediction as node classification on line graphs, which treats edges as first-class entities and enables direct relationship modeling. At the same time, we emphasize that this reformulation introduces substantial computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of the line graph. The abstract now explicitly notes that the resulting graphs can reach hundreds of thousands of nodes and tens of millions of edges, thereby justifying the need for high-performance computing resources.\n\n<b>(2) Proposed solution and HPC emphasis.</b>  \nThe abstract now clearly introduces <b>LineML</b> as a scalable framework designed to make line-graph-based learning feasible in practice. We explicitly describe its three complementary components:  \n(i) a GraphSAGE-based architecture for capturing node attributes and structural context;  \n(ii) an adaptive metric learning module with degree-biased negative sampling to address varying example difficulty and class imbalance; and  \n(iii) a pruning and parallel training system that mitigates quadratic complexity through spectral pruning and multi-GPU distributed data parallelism.  \nImportantly, following the editor\u2019s recommendation, the revised abstract places stronger emphasis on the role of high-performance computing, explicitly linking LineML\u2019s design to parallelism, real-time efficiency, and distributed optimization.\n\n<b>(3) Experimental evaluation and results.</b>  \nThe experimental part of the abstract has been rewritten to accurately reflect the results presented in the manuscript. \nWe now state that LineML is evaluated on 18 benchmark datasets and compared against 14 baseline methods. \nThe revised abstract reports that LineML achieves the highest average rank (1.0) on social and biological networks and a best average rank of 2.4 on citation networks. \nWe further summarize the statistical evidence, including near-complete dominance on social and biological datasets (Cliff\u2019s $\\delta \\geq 0.97$), substantial improvements on citation networks ($\\delta \\geq 0.73$ against 12 of 14 methods), and statistically significant gains across all categories (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, $p < 0.01$). \nIn addition, the abstract now reports concrete efficiency results, including up to a 4.6$\\times$ training time reduction via spectral pruning and a 13.98$\\times$ speedup achieved through distributed multi-GPU execution, thereby reinforcing the computational contribution of the work.\n\nThe revised abstract provides a complete, accurate, and well-justified summary of the manuscript. We hope that this comprehensive revision fully addresses the reviewer\u2019s concern and meets the expectations for completeness and academic consistency.\n\nThe full revised abstract is presented below for clarity:\n\n\\begin{quote}\n<b>Abstract.</b> Link prediction is a central task in network analysis, yet many existing methods suffer from two key limitations. \nFirst, they model edge relationships only indirectly through node-level comparisons. \nSecond, they struggle with the severe class imbalance commonly observed in real-world graphs. \nReformulating link prediction as node classification on line graphs offers a principled alternative by treating edges as first-class entities, enabling direct relationship modeling. \nHowever, this formulation introduces substantial computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of the transformed graph. The scale of the constructed line graphs, reaching hundreds of thousands of nodes and tens of millions of edges, necessitates high-performance computing resources. \nTo address these issues, we propose <b>LineML</b>, a scalable framework that reformulates link prediction as node classification on line graphs. LineML combines three complementary components: \n(1) a GraphSAGE-based architecture to capture node attributes and structural context; \n(2) an adaptive metric learning module with degree-biased negative sampling to refine embeddings under varying example difficulty; and \n(3) a pruning and parallel training system that mitigates quadratic complexity through spectral pruning and multi-GPU distributed data parallelism, enabling efficient optimization and making line-graph learning feasible in practice. We evaluate LineML on 18 benchmark datasets. The method achieves the highest average rank (1.0) on social and biological networks and a best average rank of 2.4 on citation networks. Statistical analysis indicates near-complete dominance on social and biological datasets (Cliff's $\\delta \\geq 0.97$ against all 14 baselines) and substantial improvements on citation networks ($\\delta \\geq 0.73$ against 12 of 14 methods), with statistically significant gains across all categories (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, $p < 0.01$). In addition, spectral pruning reduces training time by up to 4.6$\\times$ on the Physics dataset while preserving predictive performance. Our distributed implementation attains near-linear scaling, yielding a 13.98$\\times$ speedup over line-graph baselines on a dual-GPU system. Finally, the metric learning component remains effective under high negative sampling ratios, maintaining discriminative representations despite increasing class imbalance.\n\\end{quote}",

        "response": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. We fully agree that all scientific arguments must be directly supported by empirical evidence and that consistency between tables and discussion is essential for clarity and rigor. This comment led us to carefully review and improve the manuscript.\n\n<b>Verification of tabulated data.</b>  \nAll data reported in Tables 2 and 3 were carefully re-checked against the original experimental outputs. The evaluation pipeline was re-run, and the reported values were verified for correctness and consistency. Where necessary, minor revisions were made to ensure full alignment between the tables and the verified results.\n\n<b>Revision of the discussion for evidence alignment.</b>  \nThe discussion in Section 4.3.2 was thoroughly revised to strictly align with the data presented in Tables 3 and 4. Ambiguous or overly interpretive statements were removed or rewritten. All remaining claims are now explicitly grounded in the corresponding tabulated results, ensuring that the discussion no longer violates the principle of evidence-based argumentation.\n\n<b>Use of robust statistical significance testing.</b>  \nFollowing the reviewer\u2019s recommendation, and in alignment with \\hyperlink{comment:5.7}{Reviewer 5's Comment 5.7}, we introduced more robust statistical significance testing into the analysis. Specifically, we adopted non-parametric tests that do not assume normal data distributions and are well suited for comparative evaluation across multiple datasets. These tests improve the reliability of comparisons and strengthen the methodological rigor of the paper.\n\n<b>Addition of a dedicated explanation section.</b>  \nA new subsection (Section 4.2.1, ``Statistical Significance Testing'') has been added to the manuscript, as recommended by Reviewer 5. This section clearly describes the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Cliff's Delta effect size, why these tests are appropriate, how they are applied, and how they support fair and reproducible performance comparisons. This addition improves transparency and overall paper quality.\n\nFurthermore, the statistical analysis now includes Cliff's Delta effect sizes, which quantify the magnitude of performance differences between LineML and each baseline method. The results are visually summarized in Figure 2 (reproduced below for convenience), which clearly demonstrates LineML's dominance, particularly in social and biological networks, while also highlighting the competitive landscape in citation networks.\n\n\n    \n    \n    <div class=\"table-caption\">Table: Cliff's Delta effect sizes for LineML versus baseline methods.

The inclusion of robust statistical significance testing and its explicit explanation ensures that all conclusions are now fully supported by empirical evidence. We hope that these revisions satisfactorily address the reviewer\u2019s concerns and enhance the clarity and rigor of the manuscript.",

        "response": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for this careful and constructive comment. The conclusion plays a critical role in summarizing contributions and reinforcing the scientific value of the work, and addressing these issues has significantly improved the overall clarity, rigor, and professionalism of the manuscript.\n\nIn response to the reviewer\u2019s remarks, we have thoroughly revised the conclusion section, addressing each point raised as follows:\n\n<b>Verb tense unification.</b>  \nThe entire conclusion has been rewritten using a consistent past tense when describing completed work and experimental findings, and a clear future tense when outlining prospective research directions. This unification improves grammatical correctness and aligns the conclusion with standard academic writing conventions.\n\n<b>Logical structure and clarity.</b>  \nThe conclusion has been reorganized to follow a clear and coherent progression:  \n<ol>\n    <li> restating the problem and core motivation;  \n    <li> summarizing the methodological contributions of LineML;  \n    <li> highlighting key experimental and statistical findings;  \n    <li> emphasizing computational and high-performance computing contributions; and  \n    <li> outlining well-defined future research directions. \n</ol>\n \nRedundant or loosely connected sentences were removed, and transitions between ideas were strengthened to improve readability and logical flow.\n\n<b>Correction of OCR-related errors.</b>  \nAll OCR-related artifacts, typographical inconsistencies, and duplicated paragraphs were carefully identified and corrected. In particular, repeated and partially overlapping future-work statements have been merged into a single, concise, and coherent paragraph.\n\n<b>Standardization of data formatting.</b>  \nNumerical values, symbols, and statistical notations have been standardized throughout the conclusion. This includes consistent formatting of dataset sizes, speedup factors, Cliff\u2019s $\\delta$ values, and $p$-values, ensuring uniform presentation and improved academic rigor.\n\nThe revised conclusion section is provided below for clarity.\n\n\\medskip\n<b>Revised Conclusion</b>\n\\medskip\n\n\n\nThis paper addressed the link prediction problem, a fundamental task in network analysis that remains challenging due to indirect edge modeling and severe class imbalance in real-world graphs. \nWhile reformulating link prediction as node classification on line graphs offers a principled solution by treating edges as first-class entities, this approach introduces major computational challenges caused by the quadratic growth of the transformed graph. \nThese challenges limit the practical applicability of line-graph-based methods on large-scale networks.\nTo overcome these limitations, we proposed <b>LineML</b>, an end-to-end framework that reformulates link prediction as node classification on line graphs while remaining scalable in practice. \nLineML integrates a GraphSAGE-based encoder to capture structural and attribute information, an adaptive metric learning module with degree-biased negative sampling to handle class imbalance, and a pruning and parallel training system to mitigate quadratic complexity. \nTogether, these components enable direct edge modeling and robust representation learning under challenging data distributions.\nExtensive experiments conducted on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. \nLineML achieved the highest average rank on social and biological networks (1.0) and the best average rank on citation networks (2.4). \nStatistical analysis confirmed near-complete dominance on social and biological datasets (Cliff\u2019s $\\delta \\geq 0.97$ against all 14 baselines) and substantial improvements on citation networks (Cliff\u2019s $\\delta \\geq 0.73$ against 12 of 14 methods). \nAll observed improvements were statistically significant according to the Wilcoxon signed-rank test ($p < 0.01$).\nFrom a computational perspective, this work demonstrated that high-performance computing is essential for scalable line-graph learning. \nSpectral pruning reduced training time by up to 4.6$\\times$ while preserving predictive performance. \nThe distributed multi-GPU implementation achieved near-linear scaling and yielded a 13.98$\\times$ speedup over line-graph baselines. \nThese results confirm that pruning and parallel training are key enablers for applying line-graph-based models to large networks.\n\nFuture work will explore two main directions. \nFirst, we plan to extend LineML to dynamic and temporal graphs, where evolving network structures introduce additional scalability and modeling challenges. \nSecond, we aim to investigate adaptive and learning-based pruning strategies that can further reduce computational cost while preserving structural fidelity. \nThese extensions will further enhance the applicability of LineML in large-scale and real-world network settings.\n\\medskip\n\nWe believe that these revisions substantially improve the rigor, clarity, and readability of the conclusion section. We hope that the revised manuscript now fully addresses the reviewer\u2019s concerns and meets the expected academic standards.",

        "response": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion regarding dataset selection. \nWe agree wholeheartedly that using well-established benchmark datasets enhances the credibility, comparability, and reproducibility of our results within the broader graph learning community. \nIn response to this comment, we have significantly expanded our experimental evaluation to include four widely-used, standard benchmark datasets from the graph learning literature: <b>Cora</b>, <b>CiteSeer</b>, <b>PubMed</b>, and <b>Physics</b>. \nThese datasets, now prominently featured in our updated Table 2, serve multiple critical purposes in strengthening our study:\n<ol>\n    <li> <b>Established Baselines for Comparability:</b> These citation networks are standard benchmarks in the GNN literature, extensively used in seminal works such as Graph Convolutional Networks (Kipf  and   Welling, 2017), GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017), and GAT (Veli\u010dkovi\u0107 et al., 2018). Their inclusion enables direct comparison of LineML's performance against state-of-the-art methods using commonly accepted evaluation standards.\n    <li> <b>Comprehensive Scale Coverage:</b> While the Karate network suggested by the reviewer is indeed a classic benchmark, its extremely small size (34 nodes, 78 edges) is insufficient for evaluating the scalability and HPC-relevance of our framework. Our selected citation networks provide a meaningful range of scales: from moderate-sized networks (Cora: 2,708 nodes, 5,278 edges; CiteSeer: 3,327 nodes, 4,552 edges) to larger networks (PubMed: 19,717 nodes, 44,324 edges; Physics: 34,493 nodes, 247,962 edges). This progression allows us to demonstrate LineML's performance across realistic dataset sizes while maintaining benchmark comparability.\n    <li><b>Node Attribute Integration:</b> These citation networks feature rich node attributes (document content features), allowing us to demonstrate LineML's ability to effectively utilize node features\u2014an important capability that addresses a related concern from \\hyperlink{comment:1.8}{Reviewer 1 (Comment \\#8)} about node attribute utilization.

Notably, LineML achieves competitive results on Cora (95.14%), CiteSeer (96.85%), PubMed (98.85%), and Physics (97.70%), demonstrating robust generalization across different citation network characteristics.\n    <li> <b>Methodological Rigor Enhancement:</b> By including these standard benchmarks alongside our original specialized datasets, we strengthen the methodological rigor of our evaluation. This dual approach\u2014combining specialized networks relevant to specific application domains with widely-accepted general benchmarks\u2014provides a more comprehensive assessment of LineML's capabilities and limitations.\n</ol>\nThis expansion significantly strengthens the external validity of our claims about LineML's performance advantages.\nWe believe this comprehensive addition addresses the reviewer's concern while maintaining the technical focus on scalable graph processing that aligns with our paper's contributions to Supercomputing research. The updated experimental evaluation now provides both specialized analysis on domain-specific networks and general validation on standard benchmarks, offering readers a complete picture of LineML's capabilities.",

        "response": "We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment, which is highly relevant to improving the methodological clarity and scientific rigor of the manuscript. Explicitly introducing and properly citing statistical tests is essential for transparency, reproducibility, and correct interpretation of experimental results.\n\nIn response, we have revised our evaluation protocol and clarified the statistical methodology used. \nIn particular, we emphasize that our analysis relies on <em>more robust, non-parametric statistical tools</em>\u2014namely the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Cliff's Delta effect size\u2014which are better suited to machine learning performance evaluation than classical parametric alternatives such as the independent $t$-test and Cohen's $d$.\n\n\\paragraph{Rationale for the chosen tests.}\nThe Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric test for paired samples that does not assume normality of the data. This makes it appropriate for performance scores obtained from repeated experimental runs, which are often non-normally distributed and may contain outliers. The test evaluates whether the observed differences between paired results (LineML versus a baseline method) are systematically positive or negative.\n\nCliff's Delta is a complementary non-parametric effect size measure that quantifies the magnitude of the performance difference. Unlike Cohen's $d$, it does not rely on distributional assumptions and provides an intuitive probabilistic interpretation of dominance between methods. Together, these two tests allow us to assess both <em>statistical significance</em> and <em>practical relevance</em> in a robust and assumption-free manner.\n\n\\paragraph{Manuscript revision.}\nTo address the reviewer\u2019s request, we have added a dedicated subsection entitled <em>Section 4.2: Statistical Significance Testing</em>. This new section formally introduces the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Cliff's Delta, explains their underlying principles, and clarifies their role in our experimental evaluation. All statistical tests used in the paper are now explicitly motivated, defined, and supported by appropriate references.\n\n\\paragraph{Added references.}\nThe following references have been added to the manuscript to properly ground the statistical methodology:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Wilcoxon, F.

        "response": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for this insightful and constructive comment. We fully agree that the previous version of Algorithm 1 was incomplete and did not adequately reflect the full scope of the line graph generation process. This observation was particularly valuable, as it revealed a mismatch between the conceptual framework described in the text and its algorithmic realization, potentially affecting clarity and reproducibility.\n\nIn response, we have completely rewritten Algorithm 1 and substantially expanded the entire <em>Line Graph Generation</em> section. The revised presentation explicitly addresses the limitations of the original algorithm and introduces several important methodological components that were previously omitted or only implicitly mentioned. In particular, the following key changes and additions have been made:\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Explicit integration of node attribute transformation:</b>  \n    The original algorithm only stated that attributes were assigned to line graph nodes, without specifying how they were constructed. The revised version now clearly defines the concatenation-based feature transformation $\\mathbf{x}_{uv} = \\mathbf{x}_u \\oplus \\mathbf{x}_v$, explicitly includes this step within Algorithm 1, and links it to a dedicated subsection with formal justification and theoretical analysis.\n    \n    <li><b>Formal handling of labels and learning targets:</b>  \n    The previous algorithm ambiguously referred to assigning labels to line graph nodes. The revised algorithm now clearly distinguishes between (i) symmetric composite labels derived from endpoint node labels (when available) and (ii) binary supervision targets for link prediction, making the learning objective explicit and unambiguous.\n    \n    <li><b>Data leakage prevention through temporal partitioning:</b>  \n    The original formulation did not address potential information leakage caused by shared endpoints across temporal splits. We have added a new subsection and incorporated explicit temporal partitioning into Algorithm 1, ensuring that training, validation, and test line graphs are constructed independently and that no future information propagates into past predictions.\n    \n    <li><b>Complete end-to-end algorithmic workflow:</b>  \n    Algorithm 1 now describes the full pipeline, including edge sorting by time, split construction, line graph node and edge generation, feature and label assignment, and the final output format used by the GNN. This replaces the earlier high-level and partially specified procedure.\n    \n    <li><b>Complexity analysis and scalability considerations:</b>  \n    We added a formal complexity analysis that quantifies the time and space requirements of line graph construction, explicitly accounting for degree distribution, feature dimensionality, and the impact of concatenation on GNN parameters. This analysis was entirely absent from the original version.\n    \n    <li><b>Theoretical analysis of line graph properties:</b>  \n    To strengthen the methodological foundation, we introduced a new theoretical subsection analyzing structural properties, density implications, and expressivity with respect to the Weisfeiler--Lehman test. These results justify the design choices underlying Algorithm 1 and clarify its advantages for link prediction.\n</ul>\n\nThe revised Algorithm 1  is no longer a partial or illustrative procedure but a complete, self-contained, and theoretically grounded description of the line graph generation process. We hope that these extensive revisions fully address the reviewer\u2019s concern and that the algorithmic presentation now meets the expected standards of clarity, rigor, and reproducibility.",
