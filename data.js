        "comment": "Authors are expected to incorporate the referees' recommendations and suggestions into the final manuscript. Additionally, they must clearly articulate why their work requires supercomputing/HPC capabilities, real-time performance, and/or parallel or distributed processing. Since the journal's focus is on Supercomputing, it is essential that the revised paper demonstrates alignment with this scope. To that end, authors should explicitly justify the need for HPC/real-time power in the Abstract, Introduction, and throughout the manuscript, making a strong and consistent case for the paper's relevance to the field of Supercomputing.",
        "response": "We thank the editore for your constructive feedback and for providing us the opportunity to revise our manuscript. We sincerely appreciate your time and the detailed comments, which have significantly helped us to improve the paper and better align it with the journal's focus on Supercomputing.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>We fully recognize the importance of explicitly justifying the need for High-Performance Computing (HPC) capabilities, real-time performance, and parallel/distributed processing. Your comment is crucial because it underscores the core mission of the journal and ensures that the published work genuinely contributes to the supercomputing community. We have taken this comment very seriously and have thoroughly revised the manuscript to make a strong, consistent case for the relevance of our work to HPC.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>To address your comment, we have made substantial revisions throughout the paper. Below, we detail the specific changes we have implemented.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><ul><div class=\"para-break\"></div><li><b>1. Addition of a Novel HPC-Oriented Theoretical Framework: Line Graph Pruning</b></li><div class=\"para-break\"></div>A central enhancement to our manuscript is the introduction of a principled <b>Line Graph Pruning</b> framework (Section 3.5). This framework directly addresses the computational bottleneck of line graphs, their enormous edge count, by systematically reducing edges while preserving structural and spectral properties. The pruning serves a dual purpose: (1) as a compression technique to reduce the graphs size, and (2) as a regularization mechanism to improve generalization by removing noisy connections.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>The theoretical foundation is built on a <b>spectral distortion factor</b> \\(\\kappa\\), which quantifies how much the Laplacian spectrum (and thus global connectivity properties) is altered. We prove bounds on \\(\\kappa\\) for our pruning strategies, ensuring that the pruned graph remains a faithful representation of the original. This theoretical grounding is crucial for HPC because it provides guarantees that aggressive compression will not break the model's accuracy.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>We propose and analyze three pruning strategies:<div class=\"para-break\"></div><ol> <li><b>k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) Spectral Pruning:</b> Retains only the top-\\(k\\) most similar neighbors for each node based on feature vectors. This strategy is highly parallelizable, as the distance computations and sorting for each node are independent. We provide an algorithm (Algorithm 2) and a theorem bounding the spectral distortion.</li> <li><b>Spectral Sparsification via Effective Resistance Sampling:</b> Samples edges with probability proportional to their <i>effective resistance</i>, a measure of their importance in global connectivity. We employ a nearly-linear time approximation via Johnson-Lindenstrauss random projections, making it feasible for large graphs. The algorithm (Algorithm 3) includes a parameter \\(\\alpha\\) to explicitly control the preservation ratio, offering a tunable trade-off between efficiency and fidelity. This method is ideal for distributed settings as it minimizes communication overhead by preserving critical bridges.</li> <li><b>Degree-Based Hierarchical Pruning:</b> Leverages the power-law degree distribution of real-world graphs by removing edges incident to either very high-degree or very low-degree nodes. This simple strategy is extremely fast and reduces adjacency matrix density.</li> </ol><div class=\"para-break\"></div>A key theoretical result is <b>Lemma 2 (Training Time Reduction)</b>, which formally proves that pruning reduces per-epoch training time by a factor of \\(\\alpha\\) (the preservation ratio) and proportionally reduces communication overhead in distributed settings. This lemma provides a direct, quantitative link between our pruning framework and HPC performance gains.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><li><b>2. Comprehensive Experimental Validation of HPC Performance</b></li><div class=\"para-break\"></div>We have added an experimental section (Section 4) dedicated to non-functional performance metrics, validating the scalability and efficiency of LineML in HPC contexts. <ul><div class=\"para-break\"></div><li><b>2.1 Pruning Strategies: Performance-Scalability Trade-offs</b></li> We rigorously evaluate our three pruning methods across multiple datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed, Physics). Table 1 prennted below (Table 5 in the paper) shows that: <ul> <li><b>kNN pruning with k=10</b> achieves the best balance, removing \\(\\sim\\)76% of edges while maintaining or even improving AUC.</li> <li>Pruning provides near-linear reduction in training time (e.g., 4.6\\(\u00d7\\) speedup on Physics with kNN pruning), confirming Lemma 1.</li> <li>The benefits are most pronounced on large graphs, justifying the need for HPC to handle such scale.</li> </ul><div class=\"para-break\"></div><div class=\"table-container\"><div class=\"para-break\"></div><div class=\"table-caption\">Comparison of Pruning Methods.

We highlight spectral pruning and multi-GPU distributed data parallelism as essential components for mitigating quadratic complexity. The abstract now concludes with quantitative HPC benefits, reporting a 4.6\\(\u00d7\\) reduction in training time via pruning and a 13.98\\(\u00d7\\) speedup through distributed training.

Addressing Concern 2: Necessity of Line Graph Transformation</b> <b>This addresses your concern about whether line graph transformation is crucial by providing theoretical expressivity proofs and ablation studies.</b><div class=\"para-break\"></div><h4>Crucial Role of Line Graph Transformation</h4> The line graph transformation is fundamental to LineML's effectiveness. By reformulating link prediction as node classification on the line graph \\(L(G)\\), we enable GNNs to leverage higher-order structural patterns that are inaccessible in the original graph. Theorem 5 establishes that a \\(k\\)-layer GNN on \\(L(G)\\) is at least as expressive as \\(k\\) iterations of the 1-WL test on \\(G\\) for edge discrimination. This theoretically justifies why LineML outperforms methods that operate solely on the original graph (e.g., GAE, SEAL) or use only first-order heuristics (e.g., Katz, PR). The transformation captures edge--edge relationships, which are critical for link prediction in sparse networks.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><h4>Overcoming Computational Bottlenecks via Pruning and Parallel Training</h4> We directly address the scalability challenge of line graphs through three novel pruning strategies, each designed for HPC environments: <ol> <li><b>kNN Spectral Pruning:</b> Retains the top-\\(k\\) most similar neighbors per node based on feature distances, preserving local structure while removing redundant edges.</li> <li><b>Spectral Sparsification via Effective Resistance:</b> Samples edges proportional to their effective resistance, guaranteeing \\(\\epsilon\\)-spectral approximation of the original Laplacian.</li> <li><b>Degree-Based Hierarchical Pruning:</b> Removes edges incident to high- or low-degree nodes, leveraging degree heterogeneity.</li> </ol><div class=\"para-break\"></div><h4>Training Time Comparison with Baselines</h4> Figure demonstrates the training time speedup achieved through pruning and parallelization:<div class=\"para-break\"></div>Figure demonstrates that Parallel LineML with kNN pruning trains <b>14.09\\(\u00d7\\) faster than LGLP</b> on Physics while maintaining superior accuracy. This shows that our pruning and parallelization strategies effectively mitigate the line graph's computational bottleneck, making it practical for large-scale HPC deployments.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>C. Effect of Metric Learning: Sampling Strategies and Negative Ratios</b><div class=\"para-break\"></div><h4>Improvements via Informed Sampling</h4> LineML integrates metric learning with advanced negative sampling strategies, moving beyond first-order heuristics. We systematically evaluate four strategies (Section 5.2.3): <ol> <li><b>Random Sampling:</b> Unbiased but includes many trivial negatives.</li> <li><b>Degree-Based Sampling:</b> Favors negatives between high-degree nodes, preserving network heterogeneity.</li> <li><b>Common Neighbor Sampling:</b> Focuses on locally dense regions, suitable for social networks.</li> <li><b>Hard Negative Sampling:</b> Adaptively selects challenging negatives based on current embeddings.</li> </ol><div class=\"para-break\"></div><h4>Findings</h4> Figure shows the performance comparison:<div class=\"para-break\"></div>Key findings: <ul> <li><b>Degree-based sampling</b> paired with metric learning provides the optimal balance: median AUC of <b>0.959</b> with low variance (IQR=0.033), outperforming common neighbor and hard sampling.</li> <li>Metric learning consistently boosts performance across all strategies, most notably for random sampling (by <b>+4.2%</b>), demonstrating its role in imposing structured separation.</li> </ul><div class=\"para-break\"></div><h4>Impact of Negative-to-Positive Ratio</h4> We systematically evaluate robustness under extreme class imbalance by varying the negative-to-positive ratio from 1:1 to 100:1 (Figure ). Metric learning proves crucial: at the 100:1 ratio, it improves AP by <b>42.1%</b> and F1 by <b>48.8%</b> compared to non-metric training. This demonstrates LineML's effectiveness in maintaining discriminative power under severe sparsity through explicit geometric constraints in the embedding space.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><h4>Comparison with Other Metric Losses</h4> Figure shows that LineML's adaptive triplet loss achieves the highest median AUC (<b>96.7%</b>) and lowest variance, outperforming standard triplet, cosine embedding, and multi-similarity losses. This confirms the effectiveness of our adaptive formulation.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><h4>Revisions to the Theoretical and Empirical Analysis</h4> The revised manuscript has been substantially enhanced with expanded theoretical foundations and additional empirical analysis to more clearly articulate the contributions of LineML.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><ul> <li><i><b>First, Proposition 2 has been added</b> (Section 3.7)</i> to provide a rigorous formalization of the gradient scaling and active set expansion properties of the adaptive triplet loss, establishing the mathematical mechanism by which it accelerates learning on difficult examples compared to a fixed-margin loss.</li><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><i><b>Second, a new Theorem 5</b> (Section 4.4.5)</i> has been introduced, which establishes the expressivity of GNNs operating on line graphs by proving their equivalence to the Weisfeiler-Lehman test for edge discrimination, thereby providing the theoretical justification for the line graph transformation's superiority over first-order methods.</li><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><i><b>Third, the newly added line graph pruning section (Section 3.5)</b></i> now includes formal spectral distortion bounds and approximation guarantees (Lemma 2) that quantify the trade-off between computational reduction and structural preservation, underpinning the practical efficiency gains.</li><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><i><b>Fourth, the non-functional performance analysis (Section 4.4)</b></i> has been expanded with comprehensive scalability experiments, including distributed training results and a detailed comparison of inference latency, demonstrating LineML's practical viability for HPC environments.</li><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><i><b>Fifth, the metric learning framework analysis (Section 5.2)</b></i> has been augmented with new findings on the impact of negative sampling strategies (Figure 9) and the negative-to-positive ratio (Figure 10), providing empirical guidance for optimal configuration and highlighting the critical role of adaptive metric learning in handling class imbalance.</li> </ul><div class=\"para-break\"></div>These additions collectively strengthen the paper's theoretical grounding and provide comprehensive empirical evidence for the design choices and performance advantages of the LineML framework.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>We hope this detailed response clarifies the novel contributions of LineML and addresses your concerns.

More importantly, the revised discussion explains <i>why</i> these differences arise: NMF-based methods rely on low-rank factorization of adjacency matrices and model relationships implicitly, whereas LineML treats edges as first-class entities through line-graph transformation and leverages graph neural message passing combined with adaptive metric learning. This design enables more expressive modeling of higher-order edge interactions and improved robustness under severe class imbalance.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>The manuscript now provides a complete and balanced comparison.

First, they model edge relationships only indirectly through node-level comparisons. Second, they struggle with the severe class imbalance commonly observed in real-world graphs. Reformulating link prediction as node classification on line graphs offers a principled alternative by treating edges as first-class entities, enabling direct relationship modeling. However, this formulation introduces substantial computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of the transformed graph. The scale of the constructed line graphs, reaching hundreds of thousands of nodes and tens of millions of edges, necessitates high-performance computing resources. To address these issues, we propose <b>LineML</b>, a scalable framework that reformulates link prediction as node classification on line graphs. LineML combines three complementary components: (1) a GraphSAGE-based architecture to capture node attributes and structural context; (2) an adaptive metric learning module with degree-biased negative sampling to refine embeddings under varying example difficulty; and (3) a pruning and parallel training system that mitigates quadratic complexity through spectral pruning and multi-GPU distributed data parallelism, enabling efficient optimization and making line-graph learning feasible in practice. We evaluate LineML on 18 benchmark datasets. The method achieves the highest average rank (1.0) on social and biological networks and a best average rank of 2.4 on citation networks. Statistical analysis indicates near-complete dominance on social and biological datasets (Cliff's \\(\\delta \u2265 0.97\\) against all 14 baselines) and substantial improvements on citation networks (\\(\\delta \u2265 0.73\\) against 12 of 14 methods), with statistically significant gains across all categories (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, \\(p < 0.01\\)). In addition, spectral pruning reduces training time by up to 4.6\\(\u00d7\\) on the Physics dataset while preserving predictive performance. Our distributed implementation attains near-linear scaling, yielding a 13.98\\(\u00d7\\) speedup over line-graph baselines on a dual-GPU system. Finally, the metric learning component remains effective under high negative sampling ratios, maintaining discriminative representations despite increasing class imbalance. \\end{quote}",

        "response": "We thank the reviewer for this important observation regarding the validation of our model's capability to handle node attributes. The reviewer is correct that our initial submission did not sufficiently demonstrate this capability. In response, we have made substantial revisions to both the methodology and experimental sections to comprehensively validate LineML's ability to leverage node attributes.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>1. Enhanced Methodology for Attribute Handling</b> We have significantly expanded Section 3.4.2 to detail our node-to-edge attribute transformation mechanism. The core innovation is our Hadamard product transformation approach with optional edge feature integration:<div class=\"para-break\"></div>\\[ \\mathbf{x}_{uv} = \\mathbf{x}_u \\odot \\mathbf{x}_v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}, \\]<div class=\"para-break\"></div>where \\(\\mathbf{x}_u, \\mathbf{x}_v \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\) are the attribute vectors of nodes \\(u\\) and \\(v\\), and \\(\\odot\\) denotes the element-wise Hadamard product. When edge features \\(\\mathbf{e}_{uv} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_e}\\) are available, we enhance this with a gating mechanism: \\[ \\mathbf{x}_{uv} = (\\mathbf{x}_u \\odot \\mathbf{x}_v) \\odot \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_e \\mathbf{e}_{uv} + \\mathbf{b}_e) + \\text{MLP}(\\mathbf{e}_{uv}), \\] where \\(\\sigma\\) is the sigmoid function, \\(\\mathbf{W}_e\\) is a learnable projection matrix, and \\(\\text{MLP}\\) processes edge features.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>This approach is theoretically justified by its ability to capture multiplicative interactions between node features while maintaining dimensionality \\(d\\), offering greater expressiveness than simple concatenation without increasing parameter counts in downstream GNN layers. The Hadamard product preserves distinct information from both endpoints in the interaction space, avoiding information loss that occurs with symmetric aggregations like averaging.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>Furthermore, we have formalized the properties of our symmetric labeling scheme through Theorem 2, which establishes mathematical guarantees for preserving attribute information during the line graph transformation.

Empirically, we show in Section 3.4.4 (Fig. ) that our adaptive triplet loss, combined with degree-biased sampling significantly improves precision-based metrics (AP, F1) even under extreme imbalance (negative-to-positive ratios up to 100:1).<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>3. Dynamic Adaptation to Graph Sparsity.</b> Our line-graph transformation combined with metric learning creates powerful topological and spatial separation that enables robust link discrimination even in sparse regions. The GNN encoder captures multi-hop structural patterns while the adaptive triplet loss explicitly optimizes relative distances between positive and negative links. To address computational challenges of dense line graphs, we introduce a pruning module (Section 2.5) with three strategies: k-NN spectral pruning, spectral sparsification via effective resistance, and degree-based hierarchical pruning. For k-NN pruning we provide a spectral-distortion bound (Theorem 3), and for spectral sparsification we guarantee \\((1\u00b1\\epsilon)\\)-approximation of the Laplacian quadratic form (Algorithm 2). Lemma 2 proves that training time scales linearly with the preservation ratio \\(\\eta\\). Empirically, Table and Fig. demonstrate that k-NN pruning with \\(k=10\\) removes \\(\u2248\\)75% of edges while preserving (or improving) AUC and yielding up to \\(4.6\u00d7\\) training speedup; parallel implementation achieves \\(13.98\u00d7\\) speedup on the Physics network.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><div class=\"table-container\"><div class=\"para-break\"></div><table><tr><td><b>Methods</b></td><td><b>Param</b></td><td colspan=\"3\"><b>Cora</b></td><td colspan=\"3\"><b>Physics</b></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td><b>Pruned (%)</b></td><td><b>AUC (Imp)</b></td><td><b>Time</b></td><td><b>Pruned (%)</b></td><td><b>AUC (Imp)</b></td><td><b>Time</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><i>Baseline (Unpruned)</i></td><td>95.14</td><td>10.79s</td><td>--</td><td>97.70</td><td>1,793.08s</td></tr><tr><td>kNN Pruning</td><td>\\(k=2\\)</td><td>94.9%</td><td>85.62 (-10.01%)</td><td>6.5s (1.7\\(\u00d7\\))</td><td>95.2%</td><td>94.80 (-2.97%)</td><td>167.3s (10.7\\(\u00d7\\))</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>\\(k=5\\)</td><td>87.8%</td><td>93.18 (-2.06%)</td><td>6.2s (1.7\\(\u00d7\\))</td><td>86.1%</td><td>95.03 (-2.73%)</td><td>231.0s (7.8\\(\u00d7\\))</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>\\(\\mathbf{k=10}\\)</td><td><b>71.2%</b></td><td><b>95.61 (0.49%)</b></td><td><b>8.8s (1.2\\(\u00d7\\))</b></td><td><b>75.9%</b></td><td><b>98.07 (0.38%)</b></td><td><b>389.4s (4.6\\(\u00d7\\))</b></td></tr></table> <div class=\"table-caption\">Pruning performance (excerpt). k-NN pruning with \\(k=10\\) achieves the best trade-off: high accuracy and significant speedup across both datasets.</div><div class=\"para-break\"></div></div><div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>4. Embedding Quality under Feature-Poor Nodes.</b> LineML addresses the challenge of feature-poor nodes through a multi-faceted approach that combines structural transformation, information-preserving feature engineering, and metric learning. First, the line-graph transformation converts edge-level relationships into node-level entities, creating a richer structural context even when original node attributes are minimal. The Hadamard product transformation \\(\\mathbf{x}_{uv} = \\mathbf{x}_u \\odot \\mathbf{x}_v\\) (Section 3.4.2) captures multiplicative interactions between node features while maintaining dimensionality, preserving meaningful information from both endpoints. When node features are sparse or unavailable, this formulation allows the model to rely on the structural properties captured by the transformation itself. Additionally, the symmetric composite labeling \\(\\ell(u,v) = (\\min(\\ell(u),\\ell(v)), \\max(\\ell(u),\\ell(v)))\\) (Theorem 2) maintains label consistency under automorphisms. The adaptive metric learning framework (Section 3.7) further enhances discriminative power by focusing gradient signals on challenging cases where structural information is most needed.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>More fundamentally, when node features are entirely absent, LineML relies on the expressive power of GNNs operating on the line-graph topology itself. The GraphSAGE encoder captures multi-hop structural patterns through neighborhood aggregation, transforming pure connectivity information into meaningful representations. This structural learning is further enhanced by the adaptive metric learning objective, which explicitly optimizes the relative distances between positive and negative links in the embedding space. The combination creates a powerful inductive bias: even without explicit node features, the model learns to separate links based on their topological context and relational patterns.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>Empirically, this capability is demonstrated on networks with no node attributes, where LineML significantly outperforms alternatives. As shown in Table , on biological networks HPD, CEG, and YST LineML achieves AUC improvements of \\(3.5%\\)--\\(5.0%\\) over the closest competitor. These results validate that LineML's architecture generates discriminative embeddings through structural learning rather than reliance on rich input features, making it particularly suitable for real-world networks where node attributes may be sparse, noisy, or entirely absent.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><div class=\"table-container\"><div class=\"para-break\"></div><table><tr><td>Model</td><td colspan=\"4\">Dataset (AUC-ROC %)</td><td>Avg.

Statistical significance is validated via Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and Cliff's Delta effect sizes (Fig. 4). Scalability is demonstrated through extensive non-functional experiments (Section 4.4): parallel LineML with k-NN pruning reduces training time by up to \\(13.98\u00d7\\) on the Physics network while maintaining accuracy (Fig. ), proving its suitability for large-scale HPC deployment.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>Below we provide a structured response detailing the specific sections that have been added or updated to address the reviewer's concerns.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>I.

Foundational Significance:</b> LGLP (Cai et al., 2021) represents the first formalization of link-to-node classification via line graphs. As such, it serves as the natural benchmark for any subsequent line-graph approach, including ours.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>2. Methodological Fidelity:</b> Among recent line-graph methods, LGLP maintains the purest implementation of the core concept without additional enhancements (e.g., contrastive learning, heuristic integration, or weight prediction). This allows for a cleaner comparison of the base architectural innovation.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>3. Performance Representativeness:</b> In our expanded experiments, we found that while methods like LGCL (2023) and DuoLink (2025) show incremental improvements over LGLP on specific datasets, the performance gap between LineML and LGLP is substantially larger than between LGLP and these newer variants. This suggests our contributions (metric learning, pruning, HPC integration) provide more significant advances than recent incremental improvements.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>4. Scope Alignment:</b> Several recent line-graph methods (e.g., Liang et al., 2023 for weighted prediction; Zulaika et al., 2022 with WL labeling) address specialized scenarios (weighted graphs, specific domains) rather than the general unweighted link prediction problem we focus on.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>These substantial revisions address all concerns regarding experimental depth, baseline currency, methodological breadth, and presentation clarity.",

        "comment": "The novelty of the proposed method is not sufficiently clear. The framework appears to be a combination of existing techniques, including line graph modeling, GraphSAGE, and triplet loss. While the empirical improvements are demonstrated, the manuscript does not sufficiently explain why this particular combination is necessary. The overall motivation of the paper should be reorganized and strengthened.",
        "response": "We thank the reviewer for this critical comment, which provides an opportunity to clarify the novelty and necessity of our proposed integration. We acknowledge that our framework incorporates components that individually exist in the literature. However, the core novelty of <b>LineML</b> lies not in the invention of entirely new algorithmic components, but in their <i>synergistic integration</i> to overcome fundamental limitations that have previously prevented line-graph-based methods from being a practical solution for link prediction.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>1. The Fundamental Limitations of Current Link Prediction Approaches</b> Current link prediction methods primarily learn node embeddings \\(\\mathbf{z}_u, \\mathbf{z}_v\\) and define edge scores via a decoder \\(f(\\mathbf{z}_u, \\mathbf{z}_v)\\). This approach treats edges as implicit byproducts of node similarity, which fails to capture the <i>higher-order relational structure</i> between edges themselves, such as edge adjacency patterns crucial in social triadic closure or metabolic pathway connectivity. Additionally, while negative sampling addresses extreme class imbalance, most methods treat sampled negatives as uniformly difficult, ignoring that some non-edges (e.g., between distant, low-degree nodes) are trivial while others (e.g., between adjacent high-degree nodes) are highly challenging and informative.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>2. The Potential of Line Graph Transformation</b> The line graph transformation offers a theoretically elegant alternative by converting each edge \\(e = (u,v)\\) in the original graph into a node \\(v_e\\) in the line graph, thereby reformulating link prediction as node classification. This allows edges to be modeled as <i>first-class entities</i> and directly captures relationships between edges through the adjacency structure of the line graph. <div class=\"para-break\"></div>Despite these theoretical advantages, line graph methods have brought more challenges, which can be overcome by carefully designed training strategies and model architectures. <ol> <li><b>Computational Intractability:</b> The line graph grows quadratically in size, with \\(O(m^2)\\) connections for an original graph with \\(m\\) edges, rendering training infeasible for networks beyond a few thousand edges.</li> <li><b>Difficulty-Aware Learning:</b> Even with balanced classes, negative edge-nodes vary significantly in difficulty, requiring the model to distinguish between plausible missing links and obviously non-existent connections.</li> </ol><div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>3. LineML's Co-Designed Integration</b> LineML's components are specifically co-designed to address these challenges in a complementary manner:<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>GNN-Based Feature Learning on Line Graph</b> Our GraphSAGE-based encoder operates directly on the line graph \\(L(G)\\) to learn structural embeddings \\(\\mathbf{z}_v\\) for all line graph nodes \\(v \\in V_L\\). The model processes the initial node features through \\(K\\) layers of message passing, where each layer updates node representations by aggregating information from neighboring nodes:<div class=\"para-break\"></div>\\[ \\mathbf{h}_v^{(k)} = \\sigma ( \\mathbf{W}^{(k)} [ \\mathbf{h}_v^{(k-1)} \\| \\text{AGGREGATE}^{(k)} ( \\{ \\mathbf{h}_u^{(k-1)} : u \\in \\mathcal{N}(v) \\} ) ] ), \\]<div class=\"para-break\"></div>with \\(\\mathbf{h}_v^{(0)} = \\mathbf{x}_v\\) and \\(\\mathbf{z}_v = \\mathbf{h}_v^{(K)}\\). This approach is essential because GraphSAGE's inductive neighborhood aggregation captures both the initial features and the multi-hop structural context within the line graph. The final embeddings \\(\\mathbf{z}_v\\) encode rich information about edge relationships, enabling effective downstream metric learning and classification.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>Adaptive Metric Learning with Degree-Biased Sampling for Discrimination</b> We combine degree-based negative sampling and triplet loss with adaptive margins. This combination is crucial because scale-free networks follow power-law degree distributions, making non-edges between high-degree nodes statistically surprising and thus informative hard negatives. The adaptive margin ensures the learning objective focuses on these challenging triplets where the negative is semantically close to the anchor, refining the embedding space geometry for better discrimination.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>Spectral Pruning and HPC Parallelization for Scalability</b> We apply spectral k-NN pruning based on effective resistance to reduce the line graph's edge count from \\(O(m^2)\\) to \\(O(k \\cdot m)\\) while preserving structurally important connections. This is paired with multi-GPU distributed training optimized for sparse tensor operations. Effective resistance serves as a natural distance metric on graphs, with smaller values indicating connections critical for spectral properties. Distributed training is essential because even after pruning, line graphs for real-world networks can have millions of connections, requiring optimized parallel processing to make training feasible.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>4. Enhanced Theoretical Foundation in Revised Manuscript</b> Our revised manuscript now provides comprehensive theoretical analysis that clarifies the necessity of each component and their synergistic integration. Specifically, we have added:<div class=\"para-break\"></div><ul> <li><i><b>Line Graph Properties (Section 3.4):</b></i> Theorem 1 formally establishes line graph size properties, Corollary 1 analyzes density implications, Theorem 4 proves expressivity equivalence between GNNs on line graphs and WL tests on original graphs, while Theorem 3 guarantees leakage-free information flow in temporal settings.</li><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><i><b>Node-to-Edge Transformation (Section 3.4.2):</b></i> Theorem 2 provides formal guarantees for our symmetric labeling scheme, ensuring information preservation and automorphism equivariance during feature transformation.</li><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><i><b>Adaptive Metric Learning (Section 3.7):</b></i> Proposition 2 formally analyzes gradient scaling properties and active set behavior, demonstrating how adaptive margins accelerate convergence and refine decision boundaries for challenging negatives.</li><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><i><b>Scalability via Pruning (Section 3.5):</b></i> Theorem 3 provides spectral distortion bounds for k-NN pruning, Lemma 2 establishes training time reduction guarantees, ensuring practical feasibility while maintaining performance.</li><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><i><b>Class Imbalance Mitigation (Section 3.3):</b></i> Formal sampling distributions and Proposition 1 on degree-consistent sampling provide theoretical foundation for handling extreme class imbalance.</li> </ul><div class=\"para-break\"></div>These theoretical contributions demonstrate that our integration is not merely a collection of existing techniques, but a carefully designed framework where each component addresses specific theoretical challenges that have previously prevented line-graph methods from being practical.

        "comment": "The manuscript adopts a 1:1 undersampling strategy for positive and negative links. However, it is unclear whether this undersampling is applied only to the training set or also to the test set. In Figure 1, both the training and testing sets are labeled with \u201cPositive Link\u201d and \u201cNegative Link,\u201d which suggests that the test set may also be undersampled. If the test set is artificially balanced to 1:1, this does not truly address the class imbalance problem but only simplifies the evaluation setting. If this is not the case, the construction of negative samples in the test set should be clearly described. The ratios of positive and negative samples in the training, validation, and test sets should be explicitly reported. In addition, since the authors claim robustness, experiments under different class imbalance ratios should be considered.",
        "response": "We thank the reviewer for this insightful and critical comment, which highlights essential aspects of our experimental design and evaluation methodology. We agree completely that clarity in sampling procedures is fundamental to the integrity of link prediction studies. We have thoroughly revised the manuscript to address these concerns, providing explicit descriptions, theoretical foundations, and extensive empirical validation. Below, we address each of the reviewer's points in detail.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>1. Clarification on Sampling Across All Splits</b> The reviewer correctly notes that balancing the test set to a 1:1 ratio would simplify evaluation. We clarify that <b>we apply 1:1 undersampling consistently across all splits (training, validation, and test)</b>. This approach is justified by three fundamental considerations:<div class=\"para-break\"></div><ol> <li><b>Architectural Requirement of Line Graph Transformation:</b> The core innovation of our framework is the reformulation of link prediction as node classification on line graphs. This transformation requires a <i>fixed set of edges</i> (both positive and negative) to define the node set of the line graph. Each split (train, val, test) must therefore have a well-defined, balanced set of edges to construct its corresponding line graph. This ensures a consistent learning and evaluation framework.</li><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><b>Methodological Consistency:</b> Applying the same sampling strategy across all splits ensures that the model is trained and evaluated under the same distributional assumptions. This consistency is crucial for fair comparison and interpretation of results.</li><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><b>Theoretical and Pedagogical Foundation for the 1:1 Ratio:</b> The choice of a 1:1 ratio is grounded in our theoretical sampling framework (Section 3.3). The extreme class imbalance in networks necessitates a sampling strategy that selects the most <i>informative</i> subset of negatives. Our degree-based negative sampling (\\(p_{uv}^{\\text{deg}} \\propto d_u \\cdot d_v\\)) is explicitly designed for this purpose. It preferentially selects challenging negatives between high-degree nodes, where the absence of a link is statistically surprising. This creates a balanced (1:1) training set where every negative example carries strong pedagogical value, efficiently teaching the model to discriminate plausible from implausible missing links. Crucially, a higher negative ratio would predominantly introduce less-informative, \"easy\" negatives, diluting the learning signal and increasing computational cost without proportional benefit. The 1:1 ratio with curated, degree-biased negatives represents the optimal point for learning efficiency.</li><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><b>Computational and Conceptual Simplicity:</b> Using a balanced (1:1) test set eliminates the need for arbitrary choices about negative sample quantity during evaluation (e.g., 100 negatives per positive). It provides a clean, controlled assessment environment where each positive edge is evaluated against an equal number of negative edges, making performance metrics like AUC, AP, and F1 directly comparable and interpretable. This standardization simplifies both implementation and result interpretation while remaining theoretically justified by our sampling approach.</li> </ol><div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>2. Preventing Data Leakage in Test Set Construction</b> We emphasize that while the test set is balanced, it is constructed with strict attention to prevent data leakage: <ul> <li><b>Positive test edges</b> are held-out edges from the original graph that are never seen during training.</li> <li><b>Negative test edges</b> are sampled from the set of all non-existent edges, excluding any edges used in training or validation.</li> </ul> This procedure, now explicitly described in Section 4.3.1, ensures that the test set contains entirely novel information while maintaining the balanced structure required by our line graph methodology.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>3. Empirical Validation of the 1:1 Ratio and Robustness</b> For this concern about whether balancing simplifies evaluation is valid. We address this through both theoretical justification for the 1:1 ratio and extensive empirical validation across varying imbalance levels.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>Empirical Validation Through Ratio Experiments:</b> To directly test robustness to class imbalance, we conducted comprehensive experiments varying the training-time negative-to-positive ratio from 1:1 to 100:1. The results, presented in Section 5.1.4 and Figure , demonstrate:<div class=\"para-break\"></div><ul> <li><b>Near-Optimal Performance at 1:1:</b> While a 2:1 ratio yields a minor improvement for precision-based metrics (AP and F1), the 1:1 ratio remains highly competitive. The performance gain from 1:1 to 2:1 is minimal compared to the significant increase in training cost, validating the 1:1 ratio as an efficient and effective default.</li> <li><b>Metric Learning's Role in Robustness:</b> The adaptive metric learning component significantly mitigates performance degradation under extreme imbalance, with improvements of 42.1% in AP and 48.84% in F1 at 100:1 ratio. This shows our framework's inherent robustness.</li> </ul><div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>5. Comparative Analysis of Sampling Strategies</b> Complementing the ratio analysis, we investigated different sampling strategies in Section 5.1.3. Figure shows that degree-based sampling provides the optimal balance of accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency, further justifying its selection as the foundation for our 1:1 balanced training sets.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>These revisions address the reviewer's concerns about evaluation integrity and demonstrate that LineML's performance is robust, theoretically grounded, and methodologically sound. We believe this comprehensive response strengthens the manuscript and provides the necessary clarity for readers.",

Moreover, datasets within the same category often exhibit similar structural characteristics, making redundant ablations unlikely to provide additional insight.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>Instead, we adopt a representative-subset strategy, which is standard practice in large-scale graph learning research. The selected seven datasets span small to large graphs, sparse to relatively dense structures, and directed to undirected settings. This enables detailed analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity, metric learning components, and core architectural choices while preserving diversity across graph regimes.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>The objective of the ablation study is not to replicate performance evaluation on every dataset, but to isolate and understand the impact of key design decisions across fundamentally different network types. The consistency of trends observed in the ablation results, together with comprehensive evaluation on all 18 datasets, supports the generality of our conclusions.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>We have revised the manuscript accordingly to explicitly state this updated selection rationale and to clarify that the ablation datasets were expanded and chosen to ensure balanced coverage across all network categories.",

This includes several larger graphs (e.g., Physics, PubMed, HPD, and ZWL), in addition to small and medium-sized datasets.

We agree that any reported performance gain must be supported by clearly defined baselines and unambiguous comparison criteria.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>Upon careful re-evaluation, we observed that Tables 4 and 5 largely duplicated the information already presented in Tables 2 and 3, offering only marginal additional scientific value while potentially introducing confusion regarding baseline definitions. This observation aligns with <a href=\"#comment:2.2\">Reviewer 2's Comment 2.2</a>, which also noted the redundancy of these tables. In line with both reviewers' recommendations, we therefore decided to <i>remove Tables 4 and 5 entirely</i> from the revised manuscript.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>Rather than reporting redundant performance gains, we strengthened the experimental analysis by focusing on a more rigorous and transparent statistical evaluation framework. Specifically, all comparisons are now grounded in Tables 2 and 3 and are systematically supported by robust non-parametric statistical tests. We employ the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess the statistical significance of paired performance differences and Cliff's Delta to quantify effect sizes and practical relevance. These tests are explicitly defined, justified, and consistently applied across all baseline methods.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>Notably, the performance gains mentioned in the original Tables 4 and 5 are now rigorously quantified using Cliff's Delta effect sizes, which measure the magnitude of improvement in a standardized, interpretable manner. As shown in the new Figure , this approach provides clear, statistically grounded evidence of LineML's superiority over each baseline method, with effect sizes ranging from moderate to near-complete dominance depending on the network category and baseline type.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>This revision eliminates ambiguity regarding baseline definitions and shifts the emphasis from raw performance gains to statistically validated comparisons, ensuring that all claims are empirically supported and methodologically sound. As a result, the revised manuscript provides a clearer, more rigorous, and more interpretable evaluation of LineML relative to competing methods.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>We believe this restructuring fully addresses the reviewer's concern and significantly improves the scientific clarity and robustness of the experimental section.",

        "comment": "One of the key advantages of line graph modeling is the ability to naturally incorporate edge attributes by transforming them into node features. The authors should clarify which edge attributes are used in the experiments and whether these edge attributes contribute to the performance improvements.",
        "response": "We thank the reviewer for raising this important point about edge feature incorporation in line graph modeling. We address this comment in three parts:<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>1. Theoretical Framework for Edge Feature Integration:</b> Despite the absence of edge features in our experimental datasets, we have designed LineML with a comprehensive theoretical framework for edge feature integration. As detailed in Section 3.4.2 (Node Attribute and Label Transformation), our method includes a flexible transformation that can incorporate edge features when available. The feature vector for a line graph node \\(v_{uv}\\) corresponding to edge \\((u,v)\\) is constructed as:<div class=\"para-break\"></div>\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{x}_{uv} = ( \\mathbf{x}_u \\odot \\mathbf{x}_v ) \\odot \\sigma (\\mathbf{W}_e \\mathbf{e}_{uv} + \\mathbf{b}_e) + \\text{MLP}(\\mathbf{e}_{uv}), \\end{equation*}<div class=\"para-break\"></div>where \\(\\mathbf{e}_{uv} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_e}\\) represents edge features, \\(\\odot\\) denotes the Hadamard product, and the gating mechanism \\(\\sigma ( \\mathbf{W}_e \\mathbf{e}_{uv} + \\mathbf{b}_e ) \\) dynamically modulates node feature interactions based on edge characteristics. When edge features are unavailable, the transformation simplifies to \\(\\mathbf{x}_{uv} = \\mathbf{x}_u \\odot \\mathbf{x}_v\\).<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>2. Dataset Characteristics:</b> The benchmark datasets used in our experiments, including the 18 networks from the comprehensive evaluation in Table 2 and the additional biological and infrastructure networks, do not contain edge features. These datasets are standard in the link prediction literature (Grover and Leskovec, 2016; Zhang and Chen, 2018) and primarily include node features, structural information, and occasionally node labels. Therefore, in our experimental evaluation, we could not assess the specific contribution of edge features to performance improvements.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>While our current experimental evaluation focuses on standard benchmarks without edge features, we have established a comprehensive theoretical and methodological foundation for edge feature integration in LineML. This design choice ensures our framework's versatility and readiness for applications where edge attributes are available, while maintaining strong performance on conventional link prediction benchmarks.",

The negative samples collected in this section form the basis for subsequent link prediction, yet the paper does not explain the sampling principle or its theoretical justification. This issue is critical because both the construction of the edge network and the classification of edge\u2011network nodes rely on this sampling process. The authors should clearly specify the negative sampling strategy (e.g., random sampling, degree\u2011based sampling, temporal window sampling, or weighted negative sampling), provide theoretical or empirical justification, describe parameter settings and pseudocode, and include ablation studies showing how different sampling strategies affect performance.",
        "response": "We thank the reviewer for this insightful and constructive comment. We fully agree that a clear and justified negative sampling strategy is crucial for the integrity and reproducibility of our approach. In response, we have completely rewritten and expanded Section 3.3 (now titled ``Link Sampling Framework'') to provide a thorough theoretical foundation, detailed algorithmic descriptions, and explicit justifications. Furthermore, we have added comprehensive ablation studies in Section 5.2.3 and 5.2.4 to empirically validate the impact of different sampling strategies. Below, we detail how we have addressed each aspect of your comment.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>1. Theoretical Foundation and Sampling Principle</b> The revised Section 3.3 begins by formally defining the negative sampling problem, acknowledging the severe class imbalance inherent in real-world graphs. We explicitly state that the set of possible negative edges scales as \\(O(|V|^2)\\), making exhaustive use computationally prohibitive. The core principle we establish is that negative sampling is not merely a computational necessity but a <i>pedagogical tool</i> that shapes the model's learning by determining which non-edges are presented as informative training examples.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>We introduce a formal definition of the <b>Negative Sampling Distribution</b> \\(\\mathcal{P}: E^- \\to [0,1]\\), which assigns a probability \\(p_{uv}\\) to each non-edge. The choice of this distribution encodes inductive biases about which negatives are most valuable for learning, balancing the trade-off between trivial negatives (easy to classify but offering little learning signal) and hard negatives (challenging but potentially destabilizing early in training).<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>2. Specification and Justification of Four Sampling Strategies</b> We now explicitly describe, analyze, and justify four distinct sampling strategies:<div class=\"para-break\"></div><ol> <li><b>Random Negative Sampling:</b> Draws negatives uniformly from all non-edges. We present its formal definition (\\(p_{uv}^{\\text{rand}} = 1/|E^-|\\)) and discuss its properties: unbiasedness, preservation of the global non-edge distribution, and computational efficiency, but also its tendency to include many trivial negatives.</li><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><b>Degree-Based Negative Sampling:</b> This is our primary strategy. We define the sampling probability as \\(p_{uv}^{\\text{deg}} \\propto d_u \\cdot d_v\\), where \\(d_u\\) is the degree of node \\(u\\). <b>Theoretical justification:</b> This approach leverages the scale-free property of real-world networks. We provide a proposition and proof showing that, in expectation, high-degree nodes participate in more negative examples, preserving the network's inherent heterogeneity. The strategy generates statistically plausible negatives (non-edges between high-degree nodes are more surprising and thus more informative) and offers an optimal balance of pedagogical value and computational efficiency (\\(O(|V|)\\) preprocessing, \\(O(\\log |V|)\\) sampling).</li><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><b>Common Neighbor Sampling:</b> Favors non-edges between nodes with shared neighbors, with probability based on Jaccard similarity. We discuss its alignment with sociological principles like triadic closure and its suitability for social networks, while noting its limitations for non-social graphs (e.g., infrastructure, biology) due to strong locality bias.</li><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><b>Hard Negative Sampling:</b> An adaptive strategy that selects negatives most similar to positive examples under the current model parameters, using a softmax over similarity scores with a temperature parameter \\(\\tau\\). We discuss its theoretical aim of providing challenging examples to refine decision boundaries and its higher computational cost due to the need for continuous updates.</li> </ol><div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>3. Ablation Studies: Impact of Sampling Strategies and Ratios</b> As requested, we have added extensive ablation experiments in Section 5.1.3, ``Impact of Negative Link Sampling Strategies'' and Section 5.1.4, ``Impact of Negative Sampling Ratio''. These studies directly address how different sampling strategies affect performance.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><ul> <li><b>Figure 9 (Sampling Strategies):</b> This boxplot (reproduced below for reference) compares the ROC-AUC distributions of all four strategies, with and without metric learning, across all 18 datasets. The results show that while random sampling can achieve high median AUC (0.961) due to trivial negatives, <b>degree-based sampling provides the most reliable balance of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency</b> (median AUC 0.959, IQR 0.033). Common neighbor sampling performs worse and is less robust, while hard negative sampling is unstable and computationally expensive. The figure and analysis provide clear empirical justification for our choice of degree-based sampling.</li><div class=\"para-break\"></div> \\begin{center}<div class=\"para-break\"></div> \\end{center}<div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><b>Figure 10 (Sampling Ratio):</b> This grid of boxplots (reproduced below) investigates the effect of the negative-to-positive sampling ratio (from 1:1 to 100:1) on AUC, Average Precision (AP), and F1 score. The results demonstrate that a 2:1 ratio yields the best overall performance, and that metric learning becomes increasingly critical as the imbalance grows, mitigating performance degradation at high ratios.</li><div class=\"para-break\"></div> \\begin{center}<div class=\"para-break\"></div> \\end{center} </ul><div class=\"para-break\"></div>These new experiments provide a comprehensive empirical validation of our sampling design choices and directly answer the reviewer's request for ablation studies.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>3. Comprehensive Integration into Revised Manuscript</b> The revised manuscript now fully addresses the reviewer's concerns with comprehensive additions:<div class=\"para-break\"></div><ul> <li><i><b>Section 3.3 (Link Sampling Framework):</b></i> Completely rewritten section providing formal mathematical foundations:</li> <ul> <li>Formal definition of negative sampling distribution \\(\\mathcal{P}: E^- \\to [0,1]\\)</li> <li>Four distinct strategies: random, degree-based, common neighbor, and hard negative sampling</li> <li>Proposition 1 (Degree-Consistent Sampling) with proof showing expected degree distribution preservation</li> <li>Computational complexity analysis and practical implementation details</li> <li>Explicit connection between sampling strategy and class imbalance mitigation</li> </ul><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><i><b>Theoretical Justification:</b></i> Each sampling strategy is accompanied by mathematical formulations and theoretical justification.

        "response": "Thank you for this insightful comment. We would like to clarify an important point: our framework does not impose an arbitrary fixed limit on the number of edges. Instead, we address the scalability challenge of line graphs through a principled <b>Line Graph Pruning</b> framework (Section 4.5), which systematically reduces edges while preserving structural and spectral properties. This approach is designed for High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments, where reducing computational and communication overhead is critical. Below, we detail the edge-removal criteria for each pruning strategy and provide experimental comparisons of their performance impact.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>1. Pruning Strategies and Their Edge-Removal Criteria</b> Our pruning framework introduces three distinct strategies, each with a clear, theoretically grounded removal criterion:<div class=\"para-break\"></div><ol> <li><b>k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) Spectral Pruning:</b></li> <ul> <li><b>Removal Criterion:</b> For each node in the line graph, we retain only the top-\\(k\\) edges connecting it to its most similar neighbors (based on feature vector similarity) and remove all other edges.</li> <li><b>Justification:</b> This criterion preserves local neighborhoods that are most informative for downstream tasks by prioritizing feature consistency. It is highly parallelizable and reduces edge count while maintaining discriminative structural patterns.</li> </ul><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><b>Spectral Sparsification via Effective Resistance Sampling:</b></li> <ul> <li><b>Removal Criterion:</b> Edges are sampled with probability proportional to their <i>effective resistance</i>, a measure of their importance in maintaining global connectivity. Low-effective-resistance edges (less important) are more likely to be removed.</li> <li><b>Justification:</b> Effective resistance quantifies the contribution of an edge to the graph's spectral properties. Removing edges with low effective resistance preserves the overall graph structure (connectivity, mixing time) while achieving significant sparsification.</li> </ul><div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><b>Degree-Based Hierarchical Pruning:</b></li> <ul> <li><b>Removal Criterion:</b> We remove edges incident to nodes whose normalized degree exceeds (high-degree pruning) or falls below (low-degree pruning) a threshold \\(\\tau\\).</li> <li><b>Justification:</b> This leverages the power-law degree distribution of real-world networks. High-degree nodes have many redundant connections, while low-degree nodes often contribute less to global connectivity. Removing such edges reduces density with minimal structural impact.</li> </ul> </ol><div class=\"para-break\"></div>Each strategy includes a theoretical analysis of its impact on spectral distortion (quantified by the factor \\(\\kappa\\)) and computational complexity. The choice of criterion is explicitly linked to the desired trade-off between compression and fidelity.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>2. Experimental Comparison of Performance Impact</b> To directly address the reviewer's request for a comparison of different removal strategies, we have included comprehensive ablation studies in Section 5.2.1, ``Pruning Strategies: Performance-Scalability Trade-offs''. The results are summarized in Table 1 (reproduced below) and Figure , which show the impact of each pruning method on predictive accuracy (AUC) and training time across multiple datasets.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>Key Findings:</b> <ul> <li><b>kNN Pruning (k=10):</b> Achieves the best balance, removing 75.9% of edges while maintaining or improving AUC (e.g., +0.38% on Physics) and reducing training time by up to 4.6\\(\u00d7\\).</li> <li><b>Degree-Based Pruning:</b> High-degree pruning (\\(\\tau=0.1\\)) preserves performance well (e.g., 97.60% AUC on Physics with 70.8% edges removed) but is less effective than kNN pruning. Low-degree pruning degrades accuracy significantly.</li> <li><b>Spectral Pruning (\\(\\lambda=0.7\\)):</b> Preserves spectral properties with theoretical guarantees but requires higher edge preservation (only 30% removed) to maintain accuracy, limiting its compression benefits.</li> </ul><div class=\"para-break\"></div><div class=\"table-container\"><div class=\"para-break\"></div><div class=\"table-caption\">Comparison of Pruning Methods.

We appreciate the opportunity to clarify the relationship between classical node-to-edge conversion methods, such as link communities, and the proposed LineML framework.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>Indeed, prior work such as \u201cLink communities reveal multiscale complexity in networks\u201d has demonstrated the importance of edge-centric representations for uncovering overlapping community structures. This line of research has been highly influential in advancing our understanding of complex network organization.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>Methodological distinction.</b> In our work, the line graph transformation is employed as a structural conversion in which each edge in the original network is directly mapped to a node in the line graph, and connections are formed when corresponding edges share endpoints. This explicit transformation enables graph neural networks to learn edge-level representations optimized for prediction tasks. In contrast, link community methods typically construct weighted similarity graphs between edges based on overlap measures (e.g., Jaccard similarity) with the primary objective of clustering edges for community detection, rather than learning predictive models.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><b>Experimental focus.</b> Our experimental evaluation is therefore centered on link prediction. We compare LineML against 14 state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for this task, including classical heuristics (e.g., Katz, PageRank), embedding-based approaches (e.g., Node2vec, GAE), and advanced GNN-based models (e.g., SEAL and LGLP). In particular, the inclusion of LGLP, which also leverages a line graph representation for link prediction, provides a direct and meaningful comparison within the same problem domain.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>While link community approaches represent an important and elegant alternative for edge-centric network analysis, they address a fundamentally different research question and do not produce link existence scores or rankings required for standard link prediction evaluation. The contribution of our paper lies in advancing link prediction through adaptive metric learning on line graphs, as evidenced by the consistent performance improvements over existing link prediction benchmarks.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>Following the reviewer\u2019s valuable suggestion, we have clarified these conceptual and methodological differences in the revised manuscript to better position LineML with respect to classical node-to-edge conversion approaches.",

First, they model edge relationships only indirectly through node-level comparisons. Second, they struggle with the severe class imbalance commonly observed in real-world graphs. Reformulating link prediction as node classification on line graphs offers a principled alternative by treating edges as first-class entities, enabling direct relationship modeling. However, this formulation introduces substantial computational challenges due to the quadratic growth of the transformed graph. The scale of the constructed line graphs, reaching hundreds of thousands of nodes and tens of millions of edges, necessitates high-performance computing resources. To address these issues, we propose <b>LineML</b>, a scalable framework that reformulates link prediction as node classification on line graphs. LineML combines three complementary components: (1) a GraphSAGE-based architecture to capture node attributes and structural context; (2) an adaptive metric learning module with degree-biased negative sampling to refine embeddings under varying example difficulty; and (3) a pruning and parallel training system that mitigates quadratic complexity through spectral pruning and multi-GPU distributed data parallelism, enabling efficient optimization and making line-graph learning feasible in practice. We evaluate LineML on 18 benchmark datasets. The method achieves the highest average rank (1.0) on social and biological networks and a best average rank of 2.4 on citation networks. Statistical analysis indicates near-complete dominance on social and biological datasets (Cliff's \\(\\delta \u2265 0.97\\) against all 14 baselines) and substantial improvements on citation networks (\\(\\delta \u2265 0.73\\) against 12 of 14 methods), with statistically significant gains across all categories (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, \\(p < 0.01\\)). In addition, spectral pruning reduces training time by up to 4.6\\(\u00d7\\) on the Physics dataset while preserving predictive performance. Our distributed implementation attains near-linear scaling, yielding a 13.98\\(\u00d7\\) speedup over line-graph baselines on a dual-GPU system. Finally, the metric learning component remains effective under high negative sampling ratios, maintaining discriminative representations despite increasing class imbalance. \\end{quote}",

While reformulating link prediction as node classification on line graphs offers a principled solution by treating edges as first-class entities, this approach introduces major computational challenges caused by the quadratic growth of the transformed graph. These challenges limit the practical applicability of line-graph-based methods on large-scale networks. To overcome these limitations, we proposed <b>LineML</b>, an end-to-end framework that reformulates link prediction as node classification on line graphs while remaining scalable in practice. LineML integrates a GraphSAGE-based encoder to capture structural and attribute information, an adaptive metric learning module with degree-biased negative sampling to handle class imbalance, and a pruning and parallel training system to mitigate quadratic complexity. Together, these components enable direct edge modeling and robust representation learning under challenging data distributions. Extensive experiments conducted on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. LineML achieved the highest average rank on social and biological networks (1.0) and the best average rank on citation networks (2.4). Statistical analysis confirmed near-complete dominance on social and biological datasets (Cliff\u2019s \\(\\delta \u2265 0.97\\) against all 14 baselines) and substantial improvements on citation networks (Cliff\u2019s \\(\\delta \u2265 0.73\\) against 12 of 14 methods). All observed improvements were statistically significant according to the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (\\(p < 0.01\\)). From a computational perspective, this work demonstrated that high-performance computing is essential for scalable line-graph learning. Spectral pruning reduced training time by up to 4.6\\(\u00d7\\) while preserving predictive performance. The distributed multi-GPU implementation achieved near-linear scaling and yielded a 13.98\\(\u00d7\\) speedup over line-graph baselines. These results confirm that pruning and parallel training are key enablers for applying line-graph-based models to large networks.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>\\medskip<div class=\"para-break\"></div>We believe that these revisions substantially improve the rigor, clarity, and readability of the conclusion section.

        "comment": "3. The datasets used are relatively uncommon. Could 1-2 widely-used benchmark datasets such as Karate be added?",
        "response": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion regarding dataset selection. We agree wholeheartedly that using well-established benchmark datasets enhances the credibility, comparability, and reproducibility of our results within the broader graph learning community. In response to this comment, we have significantly expanded our experimental evaluation to include four widely-used, standard benchmark datasets from the graph learning literature: <b>Cora</b>, <b>CiteSeer</b>, <b>PubMed</b>, and <b>Physics</b>. These datasets, now prominently featured in our updated Table 2, serve multiple critical purposes in strengthening our study: <ol> <li><b>Established Baselines for Comparability:</b> These citation networks are standard benchmarks in the GNN literature, extensively used in seminal works such as Graph Convolutional Networks (Kipf & Welling, 2017), GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017), and GAT (Veli\u010dkovi\u0107 et al., 2018). Their inclusion enables direct comparison of LineML's performance against state-of-the-art methods using commonly accepted evaluation standards.</li> <li><b>Comprehensive Scale Coverage:</b> While the Karate network suggested by the reviewer is indeed a classic benchmark, its extremely small size (34 nodes, 78 edges) is insufficient for evaluating the scalability and HPC-relevance of our framework. Our selected citation networks provide a meaningful range of scales: from moderate-sized networks (Cora: 2,708 nodes, 5,278 edges; CiteSeer: 3,327 nodes, 4,552 edges) to larger networks (PubMed: 19,717 nodes, 44,324 edges; Physics: 34,493 nodes, 247,962 edges). This progression allows us to demonstrate LineML's performance across realistic dataset sizes while maintaining benchmark comparability.</li> <li><b>Node Attribute Integration:</b> These citation networks feature rich node attributes (document content features), allowing us to demonstrate LineML's ability to effectively utilize node features\u2014an important capability that addresses a related concern from <a href=\"#comment:1.8\">Reviewer 1 (Comment \\#8)</a> about node attribute utilization. The feature dimensions vary across datasets (Cora: 1,433; CiteSeer: 3,703; PubMed: 500; Physics: 8,415), enabling assessment of feature processing efficiency.</li> <li><b>Heterogeneous Performance Validation:</b> The consistent high performance of LineML on these standard benchmarks (as shown in Table 3) provides strong external validation of our methodology. Notably, LineML achieves competitive results on Cora (95.14%), CiteSeer (96.85%), PubMed (98.85%), and Physics (97.70%), demonstrating robust generalization across different citation network characteristics.</li> <li><b>Methodological Rigor Enhancement:</b> By including these standard benchmarks alongside our original specialized datasets, we strengthen the methodological rigor of our evaluation. This dual approach, combining specialized networks relevant to specific application domains with widely-accepted general benchmarks, provides a more comprehensive assessment of LineML's capabilities and limitations.</li> </ol> This expansion significantly strengthens the external validity of our claims about LineML's performance advantages. We believe this comprehensive addition addresses the reviewer's concern while maintaining the technical focus on scalable graph processing that aligns with our paper's contributions to Supercomputing research. The updated experimental evaluation now provides both specialized analysis on domain-specific networks and general validation on standard benchmarks, offering readers a complete picture of LineML's capabilities.",

        "response": "We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment, which is highly relevant to improving the methodological clarity and scientific rigor of the manuscript. Explicitly introducing and properly citing statistical tests is essential for transparency, reproducibility, and correct interpretation of experimental results.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>In response, we have revised our evaluation protocol and clarified the statistical methodology used. In particular, we emphasize that our analysis relies on <i>more robust, non-parametric statistical tools</i>, namely the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Cliff's Delta effect size, which are better suited to machine learning performance evaluation than classical parametric alternatives such as the independent \\(t\\)-test and Cohen's \\(d\\).<div class=\"para-break\"></div><h4>Rationale for the chosen tests.</h4> The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric test for paired samples that does not assume normality of the data. This makes it appropriate for performance scores obtained from repeated experimental runs, which are often non-normally distributed and may contain outliers. The test evaluates whether the observed differences between paired results (LineML versus a baseline method) are systematically positive or negative.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>Cliff's Delta is a complementary non-parametric effect size measure that quantifies the magnitude of the performance difference. Unlike Cohen's \\(d\\), it does not rely on distributional assumptions and provides an intuitive probabilistic interpretation of dominance between methods. Together, these two tests allow us to assess both <i>statistical significance</i> and <i>practical relevance</i> in a robust and assumption-free manner.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><h4>Manuscript revision.</h4> To address the reviewer\u2019s request, we have added a dedicated subsection entitled <i>Section 4.2: Statistical Significance Testing</i>. This new section formally introduces the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Cliff's Delta, explains their underlying principles, and clarifies their role in our experimental evaluation. All statistical tests used in the paper are now explicitly motivated, defined, and supported by appropriate references.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><h4>Added references.</h4> The following references have been added to the manuscript to properly ground the statistical methodology:<div class=\"para-break\"></div><ul> <li>Wilcoxon, F.

These labels represent categorical information (e.g., node types, community identifiers, or class memberships) and are defined through a vertex labeling function \\(\\ell: V \\rightarrow \\mathcal{C}\\), where \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) is a discrete label space. In practice, these labels are either provided as part of the dataset or can be obtained from community detection algorithms.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><h4>Composite edge label \\(\\ell(u,v)\\).</h4> For each edge \\((u,v) \\in E\\), the corresponding node in the line graph is assigned a composite label computed as \\[ \\ell(u,v) = \\bigl(\\min(\\ell(u), \\ell(v)), \\max(\\ell(u), \\ell(v))\\bigr). \\] The composite label \\(\\ell(u,v)\\) is a 2-dimensional discrete tuple in \\(\\mathcal{C} \u00d7 \\mathcal{C}\\). This symmetric construction ensures invariance to the ordering of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) and uniquely represents the unordered endpoint pair. The properties of this transformation (symmetry, label injectivity, order invariance, and automorphism equivariance) are formally stated and proven in Theorem 2.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><h4>Node attributes</h4> The vectors \\(\\mathbf{x}_u\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_v\\) denote the continuous-valued attribute vectors of nodes \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) in the original graph, respectively, with \\(\\mathbf{x}_u, \\mathbf{x}_v \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\). These features are typically provided as part of the dataset or can be learned through preliminary embedding methods.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><h4>Line graph node features</h4> The feature vector of the corresponding line graph node is constructed using a Hadamard product transformation (with optional edge feature integration when available): \\[ \\mathbf{x}_{uv} = \\mathbf{x}_u \\odot \\mathbf{x}_v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}, \\] where \\(\\odot\\) denotes the element-wise Hadamard product. When edge features \\(\\mathbf{e}_{uv} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_e}\\) are available, we use an enhanced transformation: \\[ \\mathbf{x}_{uv} = (\\mathbf{x}_u \\odot \\mathbf{x}_v) \\odot \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_e \\mathbf{e}_{uv} + \\mathbf{b}_e) + \\text{MLP}(\\mathbf{e}_{uv}). \\] This approach captures multiplicative interactions between node features while maintaining dimensionality \\(d\\), offering greater expressiveness than simple concatenation without increasing parameter counts in downstream GNN layers.<div class=\"para-break\"></div><i>Section 3.4.2</i> has been fully revised to clearly define all introduced symbols, explain how they are computed, explicitly state their dimensionalities, and provide theoretical justification for the chosen transformations, thereby addressing the reviewer's concern.",

        "response": "We thank the reviewer for this important observation. Upon review, we acknowledge that the \"Sampled Subgraphs\" component in Figure 1 was not adequately described in the original manuscript.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>To address this, all figures have been redesigned and enhanced to clearly illustrate the architecture of the proposed LineML framework. The revised figure now explicitly shows the workflow beginning from the original graph, followed by the link sampling phase. In this phase, a sampled subgraph is used for illustration purposes instead of the full graph, making the process more comprehensible. This sampled subgraph then proceeds through the subsequent stages: line graph generation and pruning, graph neural network (GNN) processing, metric learning, and finally the link classifier. For each task, the input and output are clearly described to ensure strict correspondence between the figure and the text.",

        "response": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for this insightful and constructive comment. We fully agree that the previous version of Algorithm 1 was incomplete and did not adequately reflect the full scope of the line graph generation process. This observation was particularly valuable, as it revealed a mismatch between the conceptual framework described in the text and its algorithmic realization, potentially affecting clarity and reproducibility.<div class=\"para-break\"></div>In response, we have completely rewritten Algorithm 1 and substantially expanded the entire <i>Line Graph Generation</i> section. The revised presentation explicitly addresses the limitations of the original algorithm and introduces several important methodological components that were previously omitted or only implicitly mentioned. In particular, the following key changes and additions have been made: <ul> <li><b>Explicit integration of node attribute transformation:</b> </li> The original algorithm only stated that attributes were assigned to line graph nodes, without specifying how they were constructed. The revised version now clearly defines feature transformation, explicitly includes this step within Algorithm 1, and links it to a dedicated subsection with formal justification and theoretical analysis.<div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><b>Formal handling of labels and learning targets:</b> </li> The previous algorithm ambiguously referred to assigning labels to line graph nodes. The revised algorithm now clearly distinguishes between (i) symmetric composite labels derived from endpoint node labels (when available) and (ii) binary supervision targets for link prediction, making the learning objective explicit and unambiguous.<div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><b>Data leakage prevention through temporal partitioning:</b> </li> The original formulation did not address potential information leakage caused by shared endpoints across temporal splits. We have added a new subsection and incorporated explicit temporal partitioning into Algorithm 1, ensuring that training, validation, and test line graphs are constructed independently and that no future information propagates into past predictions.<div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><b>Complete end-to-end algorithmic workflow:</b> </li> Algorithm 1 now describes the full pipeline, including edge sorting by time, split construction, line graph node and edge generation, feature and label assignment, and the final output format used by the GNN. This replaces the earlier high-level and partially specified procedure.<div class=\"para-break\"></div> <li><b>Theoretical analysis of line graph properties:</b> </li> To strengthen the methodological foundation, we introduced a new theoretical subsection analyzing structural properties, density implications, and expressivity with respect to the Weisfeiler--Lehman test. These results justify the design choices underlying Algorithm 1 and clarify its advantages for link prediction. </ul><div class=\"para-break\"></div>The revised Algorithm 1 is no longer a partial or illustrative procedure but a complete, self-contained, and theoretically grounded description of the line graph generation process. We hope that these extensive revisions fully address the reviewer\u2019s concern and that the algorithmic presentation now meets the expected standards of clarity, rigor, and reproducibility.",
